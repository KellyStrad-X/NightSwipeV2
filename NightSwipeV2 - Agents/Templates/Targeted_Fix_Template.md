## Issue Summary
- Briefly describe the bug or failure state (what the user or tester observes).
- Capture the exact error message(s) or console output when available.
- Note which screen, API, or environment surfaced the issue.

## Desired Outcome
- Spell out what “fixed” looks like for end users and the team.
- Clarify any non-goals (e.g., short-term workaround vs. full feature redesign).

## Implementation Steps
1. Step-by-step actions Claude should take in code, ordered logically.
2. Reference specific files and functions (e.g., `frontend/src/context/AuthContext.js`).
3. Mention guardrails (linting, patterns, things to avoid).

## Testing Instructions
- Exact flows to run after the fix (devices, API calls, console checks).
- Include both happy-path validation and regression checks if relevant.
- Note any environment toggles (offline mode, feature flags) needed.

## References
- Link or cite related logs, backlog items, or previous fixes.
- Include paths to relevant docs/specs when helpful.

> Keep the tone action-oriented and concise so Claude can pick it up quickly.
