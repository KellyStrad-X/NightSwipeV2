# S-602 – Host/Guest Match Logic & Load More (2025-10-08)

## What Changed
- Added `/api/v1/session/:id/calculate-match` so the backend intersects host/guest right swipes, stores the result on the session doc, and returns a fully-populated matches array (`Agents/Claude-Codex/Logs/2025-10-08_s602_match_logic_implementation.md`).
- Introduced `/api/v1/session/:id/load-more-confirm`, clearing old swipes/deck once everyone agrees to keep browsing and regenerating a seeded deck with Google Places data.
- Wired the deck completion flow to call the match endpoint and surface three new screens: `MatchFoundScreen` for shared likes, `NoMatchScreen` with a “Load more” CTA, and `WaitingForConfirmScreen` that polls session state until the refreshed deck lands.
- Expanded DeckScreen’s solo/two-user handling so quota logic only applies to solo runs and the multi-user path jumps straight into match or load-more flows.

## Why It Matters
- Two-user sessions now have a complete end-to-end outcome: they either celebrate shared picks or seamlessly request more options without restarting the app.
- Coordinated deck regeneration keeps both devices in sync, allowing repeat swipe cycles until a match appears.
- Surfacing match metadata on the session document paves the way for analytics and future polish work (Maps links, session restarts, etc.).

## How to Try It
1. Pull `Sprint_03_Implementations`, run the backend (`cd backend && npm run dev`) and Expo app (`cd frontend && npx expo start`).
2. Create a host session, join as guest, and swipe through the deck. When both finish, confirm that the match screen appears if you shared likes.
3. If you purposely diverge swipes, land on “No matches yet,” tap “Load more,” and watch the waiting screen until the new deck loads on both devices.
4. Repeat the cycle to confirm `load_more_count` increments and deck photos/ordering remain consistent.

## Known Gaps
- Load-more confirmations still rely on batched deletes instead of Firestore transactions, so rapid double taps could race the regeneration – earmarked for S-901.
- Swipe retry queue remains a TODO; network drops during deck completion can still produce console warnings.
- Maps deep links and match-screen restart buttons are placeholders until S-701/S-702 wire in the final UX.*** End Patch
