# S-503 – Swipe Submission & Sync (2025-10-07)

## What Changed
- Backend now accepts swipes via `POST /api/v1/session/:id/swipe`, validates deck membership, blocks duplicates, and records each decision in Firestore with timestamps (`Agents/Claude-Codex/Logs/2025-10-07_s503_swipe_submission_sync.md`).
- `GET /api/v1/session/:id/status` tallies each member’s swipe count against the deck size so we know when the session is complete.
- `DeckScreen` submits swipes optimistically, tracks how many have actually been persisted, and waits or polls the status endpoint when one partner finishes ahead of the other.
- Waiting, syncing, and completion states now surface clearly in the UI, including a “Waiting for other user…” screen with live progress.

## Why It Matters
- Swipe data finally leaves the device, unblocking match logic and analytics in upcoming stories.
- Both hosts and guests see accurate progress, so finishing early no longer leaves the first user hanging without feedback.
- The optimistic flow keeps the UI fast while ensuring the backend is the single source of truth before we advance to results.

## How to Try It
1. Pull `sprint_02_implementations`, run the backend (`cd NS-CB/backend && npm run dev`) and Expo (`cd NS-CB/frontend && npx expo start`).
2. Start a session, enter the deck, and swipe through with both gesture and button controls—watch the new console logs for submission/animation details.
3. When one user finishes early, confirm the “Waiting for …” screen appears and polls until the partner finishes.
4. Inspect Firestore: `swipes` collection should contain one document per card per user, and `/session/:id/status` should reflect current counts.

## Known Gaps
- Failed swipes only log errors; a retry queue/persistence layer is still pending (future enhancement).
- Results screens aren’t wired yet—alerts still point forward to S-601/S-602.
- Status polling is a 2-second loop for now; realtime listeners/WebSockets remain backlog items.
