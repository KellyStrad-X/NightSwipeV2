# S-601 – Solo Results & Match Flow (2025-10-07)

## What Changed
- Claude added a 3–6 card quota in `frontend/src/screens/DeckScreen.js` so solo sessions pivot to results once enough right swipes land (`Agents/Claude-Codex/Logs/2025-10-07_s601_solo_results_match_screen.md`).
- Right swipes stay in local state and pass through navigation, letting the new `ResultsScreen` carousel and `MatchScreen` detail view render full place info without extra fetches.
- Home screen’s solo CTA now spins up its own session, generates a deck immediately, and routes straight into the deck flow with loading/disabled states.
- Placeholder alerts on the match buttons mark upcoming Maps deep link and restart work so testers see the future flow without breaking the experience.

## Why It Matters
- Solo users can finally finish a swipe run, hit a randomized quota, and see tangible picks—no more dead-end flow.
- Surfacing rich place data keeps the momentum heading into the match experience planned for S-602.
- Immediate deck creation on solo start reduces tap count and keeps parity with guest-enabled sessions.

## How to Try It
1. Pull `Sprint_03_Implementations`, run backend (`cd NS-CB/backend && npm run dev`) and Expo (`cd NS-CB/frontend && npx expo start`).
2. Hit “Start Browse” on Home; a solo session and deck should materialize, taking you into the deck stack.
3. Swipe right until you meet the quota (watch the console for `🎯` logs); you’ll land on the new `ResultsScreen`.
4. Swipe through the carousel and tap a card to open `MatchScreen`; confirm Maps/Restart alerts appear and the back stack works.

## Known Gaps
- Quota count isn’t shown on-screen yet—only in logs; visible counters are slated as polish.
- Swipe retries still log errors only (no persistent queue).
- Maps deep link and deck restart live behind placeholder alerts until S-701/S-702.
