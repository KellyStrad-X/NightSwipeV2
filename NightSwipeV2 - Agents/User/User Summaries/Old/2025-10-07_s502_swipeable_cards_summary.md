# S-502 – Swipeable Deck UI (2025-10-07)

## What Changed
- Claude shipped `frontend/src/screens/DeckScreen.js`, giving us the full Tinder-style swipe stack with PanResponder gestures, animated tilt, like/nope overlays, and button fallbacks (`Agents/Claude-Codex/Logs/2025-10-07_s502_swipeable_cards_implementation.md`).
- Real venue photos now render via the Google Places data; missing images fall back to a neutral card treatment.
- Lobby routing was hardened so host or guest checks for an existing deck, generates it if needed, and then enters the deck flow without duplicate POSTs.
- Backend exposes `GET /api/v1/session/:id/deck` so reconnecting clients reuse the stored order instead of regenerating on every visit.

## Why It Matters
- Couples can actually browse the session deck delivered in S-501, moving us into a “nearly runnable” MVP loop ahead of swipe submission work.
- Deterministic ordering is preserved from the GET endpoint, so both users see the same venue order and QA can reproduce matches.
- The deck screen establishes the layout and animation patterns S-503 will hook into for persistence, keeping future work incremental.

## How to Try It
1. Pull `sprint_02_implementations`, start the backend (`cd NS-CB/backend && npm run dev`) and Expo app (`cd NS-CB/frontend && npx expo start`).
2. Create or join a session until both users are in the lobby, then press “Start Browse” (either side); it will generate (or reuse) the deck and push you to the new Deck screen.
3. Swipe a few cards left/right and watch the animations, overlays, and progress counter advance; finish the stack to see the completion screen.
4. Back out to the lobby and re-enter—DeckScreen should fetch the existing deck via GET without hitting the generator again.

## Known Gaps
- Swipes still stay local; S-503 will log likes/nope to the backend and trigger match logic.
- Gestures use the classic Animated API; performance is solid but we may migrate to Reanimated for richer effects later.
- Guests don’t see host progress yet—real-time sync needs separate backlog items once swipe submission is in place.
