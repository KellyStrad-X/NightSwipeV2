# NightSwipe MVP – Sprint 02 Wrap-Up (2025-10-05)

## Snapshot
- Sprint 02 brings the storyboarded home experience to life: the moon logo glides into place, CTAs adapt to your state, and location prompts fire when you’re ready to explore (`../NS-CB/frontend/src/screens/HomeScreen.js:14`).
- Location permissions now flow through a shared context that caches coordinates, surfaces friendly alerts, and hands callers a ready-to-use lat/lng pair (`../NS-CB/frontend/src/context/LocationContext.js:15`).
- The backend can create and join two-person sessions with secure Firebase token checks and Firestore storage, setting us up for invites and shared decks (`../NS-CB/backend/src/routes/session.js:37`).

## What Changed
- Home screen UI rewired with animated logo, “Start Searching” lift, and follow-up buttons for inviting a partner or diving straight into browsing (`../NS-CB/frontend/src/screens/HomeScreen.js:68`).
- Location provider added to the app shell and Expo permissions declared so iOS/Android both show the NightSwipe rationale before sharing GPS (`../NS-CB/frontend/App.js:1`, `../NS-CB/frontend/app.json:2`).
- `expo-location` dependency bundled to power accurate coordinate fetches on device (`../NS-CB/frontend/package.json:1`).
- New Express router covers `POST /session`, `POST /session/:id/join`, and `GET /session/:id`, issuing short join codes and enforcing the 2-person limit (`../NS-CB/backend/src/routes/session.js:37`).
- API index now advertises the session endpoints alongside the health check so testers know where to point Postman (`../NS-CB/backend/src/server.js:27`).

## Why It Matters
- Couples now see a branded, animated home instead of a placeholder list, giving the app a polished first impression while we build out invites.
- We capture high-accuracy coordinates the moment a user tries to browse or send an invite, keeping the Places deck snappy once we hook up the API.
- Sessions are persisted and guarded by Firebase tokens, so future lobby and swipe flows can trust the backend without revisiting auth.

## How to Try It
1. Pull `main`, install deps, and ensure both `.env` files still carry your Firebase + Places keys.
2. Start the API (`npm start` in `/backend`); watch for the Firebase init log and keep the server running.
3. Launch the Expo app on a device, sign in, and tap “Start Searching” → “Invite Someone” to trigger the location prompt and check the console for coordinates (`../NS-CB/frontend/src/screens/HomeScreen.js:121`).
4. Grab two Firebase ID tokens (host + guest) and hit the new session endpoints with curl/Postman to create a room, join from the guest token, and fetch the combined session snapshot (`../NS-CB/backend/src/routes/session.js:116`).

## Known Gaps
- Deep-link join flow (S-203) is still queued; guests must enter via manual navigation for now (`Agents/Claude-Codex/Logs/2025-10-05_s301_s302_s401_implementation.md:360`).
- Session expiration, cleanup, and rate limiting remain future hardening tasks before we ship invites widely (`Agents/Claude-Codex/Logs/2025-10-05_s301_s302_s401_implementation.md:332`).
- Deck fetch and invite UI still use placeholder console logs until Sprint 03 stitches in the Places API and lobby screens (`../NS-CB/frontend/src/screens/HomeScreen.js:47`).
