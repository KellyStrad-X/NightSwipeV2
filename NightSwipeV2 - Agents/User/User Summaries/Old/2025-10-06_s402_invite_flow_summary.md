# S-402 – Invite Flow UI & Lobby (2025-10-06)

## What Changed
- Designed the full host invite modal UX: shows host info, exposes the join link, and lets you copy or share it (Twilio SMS remains a future add-on per backlog). Reference: `Agents/Claude-Codex/Logs/2025-10-06_s402_invite_flow_implementation.md`.
- Added host/guest lobby states that poll the session every 2 seconds, display both participants, and surface status transitions (waiting, joined, cancelled, expired).
- Tied deep links into the flow so unauthenticated guests store their join code, log in, and land in the lobby automatically once authenticated.
- Documented the new backend endpoints Claude introduced (`GET /session/by-code/:code`, `PATCH /session/:id`) and the frontend navigation notes for the upcoming deck start.

## Why It Matters
- Hosts can now create sessions, distribute links, and see when their guest connects—core MVP loop is wired up end-to-end pending deck work.
- Guests who accept an invite aren’t lost after the login wall; the lobby opens with both names and the join status once auth passes.
- The implementation log captures every component and API touchpoint, so the team has a clear map before QA or future enhancements (Twilio SMS, WebSockets).

## How to Try It
1. Follow the test script in the log to spin up the host flow, copy/share the invite link, and watch the lobby update when the guest joins (`Agents/Claude-Codex/Logs/2025-10-06_s402_invite_flow_implementation.md`).
2. Use two devices (or simulator + physical) to simulate host and guest, confirming the polling updates, cancel button, and “Start Browse” CTA (placeholder alert until deck work lands).
3. Test the deep-link path: open `nightswipe://join?code=...` while logged out, log in, and ensure the lobby appears with the stored code.

## Known Gaps
- Phone number entry + Twilio SMS send were intentionally deferred; they reappear in the backlog notes for future sprint wiring.
- “Start Browse” still fires a placeholder alert—the deck fetch/swipe stories (S-501/S-502) must land next.
- No WebSocket yet; polling handles lobby sync for MVP but could be swapped later for real-time updates.
