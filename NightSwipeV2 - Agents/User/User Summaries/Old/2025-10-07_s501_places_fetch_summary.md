# S-501 – Places Deck Fetch (2025-10-07)

## What Changed
- Claude wired up `POST /api/v1/session/:id/deck` so the backend hits Google Places, normalizes 20–25 restaurants/bars/cafes, and stores a deterministic, ordered deck for each session (`Agents/Claude-Codex/Logs/2025-10-07_s501_places_fetch_implementation.md`).
- Deck entries now include name, category, rating, crowd size (reviews), distance, and a photo reference so hosts and guests will swipe the same list.
- The lobby “Start Browse” button calls the new endpoint, shows a loading state, and confirms how many venues were found once the deck is built (`frontend/src/screens/LobbyScreen.js` in `NS-CB` repo).
- Backend configuration docs gained the `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` placeholder so the host machine can supply credentials before testing.

## Why It Matters
- With the deck service in place, the invite lobby can transition from “joined” to “browsing” as soon as S-502 ships the swipe UI.
- Deterministic shuffling keeps host and guest aligned, which is critical once we add matchmaking and swipe sync.
- We now persist decks in Firestore, giving us a backbone for analytics, retries, and rejoining without regenerating data (GET endpoint still to come).

## How to Try It
1. Add a valid `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` to `backend/.env` on the host machine, then run `npm run dev` from `NS-CB/backend`.
2. In another terminal, start the Expo app (`cd NS-CB/frontend && npx expo start`), create a session as host, invite a guest, and wait for them to join.
3. As the host, tap “Start Browse” in the lobby; you should see a “Generating Deck…” spinner, followed by a success alert that reports the total venues fetched.
4. Inspect Firestore under `sessions/{sessionId}/deck` to confirm the stored list, seed value, and place ordering described in the implementation log.

## Known Gaps
- We still return a placeholder alert instead of navigating to swipe UI—S-502 must consume this deck data.
- The endpoint blocks repeated generation but there’s no `GET /session/:id/deck` yet, so reconnecting clients can’t fetch the existing list without a manual Firestore read.
- Google Places quota, pagination, and caching need monitoring; retries expand to 10km but we don’t yet reuse results across sessions.
