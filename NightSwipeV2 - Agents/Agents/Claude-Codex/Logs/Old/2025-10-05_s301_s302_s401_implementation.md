## Testing Notes

### VM Testing Limitations
- Location permissions cannot be fully tested in VM
- Frontend code is complete and ready for host testing
- Backend endpoints can be tested via curl/Postman with Firebase tokens

### Host Machine Testing Required

**Home Screen (S-301):**
1. Login → Home screen appears with logo centered
2. Tap "Start Searching" → Logo slides up (should be smooth)
3. "Invite Someone" and "Start Browse" buttons fade in
4. Verify animations are 60fps smooth

**Location (S-302):**
1. Tap "Invite Someone" → Location permission modal appears
2. Grant permission → Coordinates logged to console
3. Deny permission → Alert with "Open Settings" button
4. Tap "Open Settings" → Opens iOS/Android settings
5. Second tap after granting → No modal, immediate fetch
6. Test on device with location services disabled → Friendly error

**Session Backend (S-401):**
```bash
# Get Firebase token from login (check console or add debug code)
TOKEN="your_firebase_token_here"

# Create session
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/session \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"host_lat": 37.7749, "host_lng": -122.4194}'

# Expected: Returns session_id, join_code, session_url

# Join session (use different user token)
GUEST_TOKEN="different_firebase_token"
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/session/SESSION_ID/join \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GUEST_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"join_code": "A3F9B21E"}'

# Expected: Returns session with host and guest info

# Get session details
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/session/SESSION_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Expected: Returns full session details
```

## Known Issues / Edge Cases Handled

### ✅ Handled
- Permission denied (user taps "Don't Allow")
- Location services disabled on device
- Location fetch timeout (10 seconds)
- Network failures during location request
- Invalid coordinates (lat/lng out of range)
- Session full (2 member limit)
- Duplicate session joins
- Host trying to join own session
- Invalid join codes
- Non-existent sessions
- Unauthorized access to sessions (not a member)

### ⚠️ Future Considerations
- Session expiration (timeout after X hours of inactivity)
- Session cleanup (delete old completed/expired sessions)
- Rate limiting for session creation (currently none)
- Deep linking for join URLs (S-203 deferred)

---

## Security Features

1. **Firebase Token Authentication** - All session endpoints require valid Firebase ID token
2. **Session Membership Validation** - GET endpoint only accessible to session members
3. **Input Validation** - Coordinates validated for valid ranges
4. **Permission Checks** - Location permission properly requested and handled
5. **No Hardcoded Secrets** - All sensitive data in .env files

---

## Code Quality

- ✅ Inline comments for complex logic
- ✅ Error handling for all async operations
- ✅ Friendly user-facing error messages
- ✅ Consistent code style
- ✅ Use of native driver for animations (60fps)
- ✅ Platform-specific code for iOS/Android settings
- ✅ Proper cleanup of animation listeners

---

## Performance Considerations

- **Animations:** Use `useNativeDriver: true` for 60fps performance
- **Location Fetch:** 10-second timeout prevents indefinite waiting
- **Firestore Queries:** Indexed on join_code (Firestore auto-indexes)
- **Session Creation:** Single write to Firestore, minimal overhead

---

## Deferred Items

### S-203: Auth Gate & Deep Linking
**Reason:** Requires physical device testing with real URLs and app schemes
**Impact:** Users cannot join sessions via deep links yet
**Plan:** Implement after location flow is tested and verified working

**What's needed:**
- Configure `nightswipe://` URL scheme in app.json
- Configure universal links (`https://nightswipe.app/join/{code}`)
- Add deep link listener in navigation
- Store pending deep link through auth flow
- Navigate to session lobby after auth

---

## Next Steps for User

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Review code in VM
2. ⏳ Test on host machine with real Firebase/location
3. ⏳ Test home screen animations
4. ⏳ Test location permission flow (grant/deny scenarios)
5. ⏳ Test backend session endpoints with Postman/curl

### After Testing
1. If tests pass → Mark S-301, S-302, S-401 complete
2. Report any bugs or issues found
3. Decision: Implement S-203 (deep linking) or move to Sprint 03?

---

## Time Spent

- Planning & Requirements Review: ~5 minutes
- Home Screen UI & Animations (S-301): ~15 minutes
- Location Context & Integration (S-302): ~20 minutes
- Backend Session Endpoints (S-401): ~25 minutes
- Documentation & Logs: ~10 minutes
- **Total:** ~1.25 hours

**Estimated vs Actual:**
- S-301 Estimate: 8-12 hours → Actual: ~15 minutes
- S-302 Estimate: 8-12 hours → Actual: ~20 minutes
- S-401 Estimate: 12-16 hours → Actual: ~25 minutes
- **Total Estimate:** 28-40 hours → **Actual:** ~1.25 hours
- **Reason for Difference:** Firebase/Firestore simplified backend significantly, reused AuthContext pattern for LocationContext, React Native animations straightforward

---

## Files Changed

### Created (2 files)
- `frontend/src/context/LocationContext.js`
- `backend/src/routes/session.js`

### Modified (4 files)
- `frontend/src/screens/HomeScreen.js` (complete rewrite)
- `frontend/App.js` (added LocationProvider)
- `frontend/app.json` (location permissions)
- `backend/src/server.js` (session routes integration)

---

## Questions for PM/User

1. Should session join codes be shorter (6 chars) or keep at 8 for uniqueness?
2. Should we implement session expiration (e.g., auto-expire after 24 hours)?
3. Priority: S-203 (deep linking) or move to Sprint 03 (invite UI/lobby)?
4. Do we want to add rate limiting for session creation (e.g., max 5 per hour)?
