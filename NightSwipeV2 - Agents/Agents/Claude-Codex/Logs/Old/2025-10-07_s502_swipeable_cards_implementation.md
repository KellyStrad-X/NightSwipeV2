**Date:** 2025-10-07
**Sprint:** Sprint 03 - Invite Flow & Deck Mechanics
**Story:** S-502 ‚Äî Swipeable Card UI & Animations
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete (Ready for S-503)
**Estimated Effort:** 16-20 hours
**Actual Effort:** ~4 hours
**Developer:** Claude (Code Implementor)

---

## Summary

Implemented complete Tinder-style swipeable card interface for browsing places. Users can swipe left (reject) or right (like) on venue cards, with smooth animations, visual feedback overlays, real photo loading from Google Places API, and button fallback controls. Both host and guest can browse the same deck independently with synchronized place ordering.

---

## Acceptance Criteria Status

### Card Stack UI ‚úÖ
- [x] Display deck of place cards (data from S-501)
- [x] Show top card prominently, stack 2-3 behind with offset/scale effect
- [x] Card displays: photo, name, category, rating, address, distance
- [x] Real photos loaded from Google Places API
- [x] Graceful fallback for missing photos

### Swipe Gestures ‚úÖ
- [x] Swipe left ‚Üí Dismiss (no interest)
- [x] Swipe right ‚Üí Like (interested)
- [x] Visual feedback: card tilts in swipe direction
- [x] On release past threshold ‚Üí Card flies off screen, next card animates forward
- [x] On release below threshold ‚Üí Card springs back to center
- [x] Threshold: 40% of screen width

### Visual Indicators ‚úÖ
- [x] Swipe left: Red overlay with "‚úó" icon fades in
- [x] Swipe right: Green overlay with "‚ô•" icon fades in
- [x] Opacity scales with swipe distance

### Button Fallback ‚úÖ
- [x] Bottom of screen: "‚úó" (left) and "‚ô•" (right) buttons
- [x] Tap buttons to swipe programmatically
- [x] Same animation as gesture

### Progress Indicator ‚úÖ
- [x] Show card count: "3 / 25" at top
- [x] Update as user swipes

### End of Deck ‚úÖ
- [x] After last card swiped, show completion screen
- [x] "All done! üéâ" message with card count
- [x] "Back to Lobby" button

### Performance ‚úÖ
- [x] Animations run smoothly on physical devices
- [x] No jank or lag during swipe

## Technical Implementation

### New Files Created

#### 1. `frontend/src/screens/DeckScreen.js` (NEW - 536 lines)

**Purpose:** Main swipe interface for browsing places

**Key Features:**
- PanResponder for swipe gesture detection
- Animated API for smooth card movements
- Card stack rendering with depth effect
- Real-time swipe feedback overlays
- Progress tracking
- Photo loading from Google Places API
- End of deck handling

**State Management:**
```javascript
const [deck, setDeck] = useState([]);           // Array of places
const [currentIndex, setCurrentIndex] = useState(0);  // Current card
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);   // Initial load
const [error, setError] = useState(null);       // Error handling

const position = useRef(new Animated.ValueXY()).current;  // Card position
const swipeDirection = useRef(new Animated.Value(0)).current;  // Swipe direction
```

**Gesture Handling:**
- `PanResponder.create()` - Captures touch/drag events
- `onPanResponderMove` - Updates card position as user drags
- `onPanResponderRelease` - Determines swipe vs spring-back
- Threshold: 40% of screen width (SWIPE_THRESHOLD)

**Animation Functions:**

1. **`forceSwipe(direction)`**
   - Animates card flying off screen
   - 250ms timing animation
   - Calls `onSwipeComplete()` after animation

2. **`resetPosition()`**
   - Springs card back to center
   - Friction: 5 (bouncy effect)
   - Used when swipe doesn't meet threshold

3. **`getCardStyle()`**
   - Interpolates rotation based on X position
   - Range: -30¬∞ to +30¬∞
   - Smooth tilt effect during drag

4. **`getLikeOpacity()` / `getNopeOpacity()`**
   - Fade overlays based on swipe distance
   - Green (like) fades in on right swipe
   - Red (nope) fades in on left swipe

**Card Rendering:**

```javascript
renderCard(place, index):
  if (index < currentIndex) return null;  // Already swiped

  if (index === currentIndex) {
    // Active card - full interaction
    return (
      <Animated.View with gestures>
        - Like overlay (green ‚ô•)
        - Nope overlay (red ‚úó)
        - Photo (Google Places API)
        - Place info (name, category, rating, etc.)
      </Animated.View>
    );
  }

  // Background cards - scaled and offset
  return (
    <Animated.View with scale/translateY>
      - Preview of next place
    </Animated.View>
  );
```

**Deck Fetching:**
```javascript
fetchDeck() with retry mechanism:
  - GET /api/v1/session/:id/deck
  - Retry up to 3 times with progressive backoff (500ms, 1s, 1.5s)
  - Handles Firestore eventual consistency
  - Sorts by order field
  - Sets deck state
```

**Photo Loading:**
- Uses React Native `<Image>` component
- Loads from `place.photo_url` (Google Places Photo API)
- Fallback to placeholder emoji if URL is placeholder.com
- `resizeMode="cover"` for proper aspect ratio
- Error handling for failed loads

**End of Deck:**
```javascript
if (currentIndex >= deck.length):
  - Show completion screen
  - Display total cards swiped
  - "Back to Lobby" button
  - üéâ emoji celebration
```

**Swipe Completion:**
```javascript
onSwipeComplete(direction):
  - Uses functional setState to avoid closure issues
  - Safely reads place from prevIndex
  - Logs swipe direction and place name
  - Increments currentIndex
  - Resets card position for next card
  - TODO: S-503 will submit swipe to backend
```

---

### Modified Files

#### 2. `frontend/App.js` (UPDATED)

**Changes:**
- Added `DeckScreen` import
- Added `<Stack.Screen name="Deck" component={DeckScreen} />` to authenticated navigation

**Navigation Structure:**
```javascript
{currentUser ? (
  <>
    <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
    <Stack.Screen name="Lobby" component={LobbyScreen} />
    <Stack.Screen name="Deck" component={DeckScreen} />  // NEW
  </>
) : (
  // ... auth screens
)}
```

#### 3. `frontend/src/screens/LobbyScreen.js` (UPDATED)

**Changes:**

1. **Start Browse Button Visibility:**
   - Changed from `isHost && hasGuest` to just `hasGuest`
   - Both host and guest can now tap "Start Browse"
   - Enables independent browsing

2. **handleStartBrowse() - Smart Deck Check:**

```javascript
// Before (S-501):
- POST to generate deck
- Handle "already exists" error
- Navigate

// After (S-502):
- First: GET to check if deck exists
- If exists: Navigate directly (no error)
- If 404: POST to generate deck
- Then: Navigate to DeckScreen
```

**Flow:**
```
User taps "Start Browse"
  ‚Üì
GET /session/:id/deck
  ‚Üì
Exists? ‚Üí Navigate to Deck ‚úÖ
  ‚Üì
404? ‚Üí POST /session/:id/deck ‚Üí Navigate ‚úÖ
  ‚Üì
Other error? ‚Üí Show alert ‚ùå
```

This eliminates the spurious "Deck already generated" error that guests were seeing.

#### 4. `backend/src/routes/session.js` (UPDATED)

**New Endpoint Added:**

**`GET /api/v1/session/:id/deck`** (67 lines)

**Purpose:** Retrieve existing deck from Firestore

**Request:**
```
GET /api/v1/session/:id/deck
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <firebase_token>
```

**Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "deck": [
    {
      "place_id": "ChIJN1t_tDeuEmsRUsoyG83frY4",
      "name": "The Purple Turtle",
      "photo_url": "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/photo?...",
      "category": "Bar",
      "rating": 4.2,
      "review_count": 347,
      "address": "123 Main St, Brooklyn",
      "distance_km": 1.3,
      "order": 0
    },
    // ... 19-24 more places
  ],
  "deck_seed": "40.7128_-74.0060_1696723456789",
  "total_count": 25
}
```

**Implementation:**
1. Validate session exists
2. Check user is session member
3. Check deck_seed exists (deck was generated)
4. Query `sessions/{id}/deck` subcollection
5. Sort places by `order` field
6. Return sorted deck array

**Error Handling:**
- 404: Session not found or deck not generated
- 403: User not a session member
- 500: Database error

#### 5. `backend/src/server.js` (UPDATED)

**API Endpoint List Updated:**
```javascript
endpoints: {
  // ... existing
  deck_get: 'GET /api/v1/session/:id/deck (protected)',      // NEW
  deck_create: 'POST /api/v1/session/:id/deck (protected)'   // Renamed
}
```

## Bug Fixes & Improvements

### Bug Fix 1: Guest Navigation Issue

**Problem:**
- Only host had "Start Browse" button
- Guest couldn't navigate to deck screen
- Guest saw "Waiting for host to start..." indefinitely

**Root Cause:**
```javascript
// Old condition:
{isHost && hasGuest && (
  <TouchableOpacity>Start Browse</TouchableOpacity>
)}
```

**Fix:**
```javascript
// New condition:
{hasGuest && (
  <TouchableOpacity>Start Browse</TouchableOpacity>
)}
```

Both users can now browse independently once both have joined.

**File:** `frontend/src/screens/LobbyScreen.js:260`

---

### Bug Fix 2: Guest Deck Generation Error

**Problem:**
- Guest tapped "Start Browse" ‚Üí tried to POST /deck
- Deck already existed (host generated it) ‚Üí 400 error
- Alert shown but deck loaded anyway (confusing UX)

**Root Cause:**
LobbyScreen always tried to POST without checking if deck exists.

**Fix:**
Added smart check-then-generate logic:

```javascript
handleStartBrowse():
  try:
    GET /session/:id/deck
    ‚Üí Success: Navigate (deck exists)
  catch (404):
    POST /session/:id/deck
    ‚Üí Navigate (deck generated)
  catch (other):
    Show error
```

**Files:** `frontend/src/screens/LobbyScreen.js:104-145`

---

### Bug Fix 3: First Card Swipe Crash

**Problem:**
```
Uncaught Error: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
at onSwipeComplete (DeckScreen.js:107)
```

**Root Cause:**
React state closure issue - `onSwipeComplete` was using stale `currentIndex` value:

```javascript
// Problematic code:
const onSwipeComplete = (direction) => {
  const currentPlace = deck[currentIndex];  // ‚ùå Stale value
  console.log(currentPlace.name);
  setCurrentIndex(currentIndex + 1);
};
```

When animation completed, `currentIndex` might have already been incremented elsewhere, causing `deck[currentIndex]` to be undefined.

**Fix:**
Use functional setState update:

```javascript
const onSwipeComplete = (direction) => {
  setCurrentIndex(prevIndex => {
    const currentPlace = deck[prevIndex];  // ‚úÖ Fresh value
    if (currentPlace) {
      console.log(currentPlace.name);
    }
    return prevIndex + 1;
  });
  position.setValue({ x: 0, y: 0 });
};
```

**File:** `frontend/src/screens/DeckScreen.js:104-119`

---

### Bug Fix 4: Photo Loading

**Problem:**
- Cards showed placeholder emoji instead of real photos
- `photo_url` field existed but wasn't being used

**Fix:**
Added React Native `<Image>` component with proper loading:

```javascript
<Image
  source={{ uri: place.photo_url }}
  style={styles.photo}
  resizeMode="cover"
  onError={() => console.log('Failed to load image')}
/>
```

**Fallback logic:**
```javascript
{place.photo_url && !place.photo_url.includes('placeholder.com') ? (
  <Image source={{ uri: place.photo_url }} />
) : (
  <View>üì∑ No photo available</View>
)}
```

**Files:**
- `frontend/src/screens/DeckScreen.js:200-214` (active card)
- `frontend/src/screens/DeckScreen.js:259-269` (stack preview)
- `frontend/src/screens/DeckScreen.js:451-467` (styles)

---

### Bug Fix 5: Firestore Race Condition

**Problem:**
Console error on navigation to DeckScreen:
```
API GET /api/v1/session/:id/deck failed:
Error: Deck has not been generated for this session yet
```

**Root Cause:**
1. LobbyScreen POSTs to generate deck (stores in Firestore)
2. POST returns success ‚Üí navigates to DeckScreen
3. DeckScreen immediately GETs deck
4. Firestore write hasn't fully propagated ‚Üí 404
5. Then Firestore catches up ‚Üí data available

**Fix:**
Added retry mechanism with progressive backoff:

```javascript
fetchDeck(retryCount = 0):
  try:
    GET /session/:id/deck
    ‚Üí Success!
  catch (404):
    if retryCount < 3:
      wait (500ms * (retryCount + 1))
      fetchDeck(retryCount + 1)
    else:
      Show error
```

Retry delays: 500ms, 1s, 1.5s (total: 3s window for consistency)

**File:** `frontend/src/screens/DeckScreen.js:47-79`

**Note:** Console error still appears briefly (can't prevent the initial 404), but retry succeeds immediately. User doesn't see any error.

---

## User Flows

### Flow 1: Host Creates Deck & Browses (Happy Path)

1. **Host taps "Start Browse"** in lobby
2. **LobbyScreen checks:** GET /session/:id/deck
3. **404 returned** (deck doesn't exist yet)
4. **LobbyScreen generates:** POST /session/:id/deck
   - Google Places API called
   - 20-25 places fetched
   - Normalized and shuffled
   - Stored in Firestore
5. **Navigate to DeckScreen**
6. **DeckScreen fetches:** GET /session/:id/deck
7. **Deck loaded** (20 places, sorted by order)
8. **User sees:**
   - Progress: "1 / 20"
   - Top card with photo, name, rating, etc.
   - 2 cards stacked behind
9. **User swipes right** (likes restaurant)
   - Card tilts right as dragged
   - Green ‚ô• overlay fades in
   - Card flies off screen to the right
   - Next card animates forward
   - Progress: "2 / 20"
10. **User swipes left** (rejects bar)
    - Card tilts left as dragged
    - Red ‚úó overlay fades in
    - Card flies off screen to the left
    - Next card animates forward
    - Progress: "3 / 20"
11. **User swipes through all 20 cards**
12. **End of deck screen appears:**
    - "üéâ All done!"
    - "You've swiped through all 20 places"
    - "Back to Lobby" button
13. **User taps "Back to Lobby"**
14. **Returns to lobby screen**

---

### Flow 2: Guest Joins & Browses Existing Deck

1. **Guest joins session** (already in lobby)
2. **Guest sees "Start Browse" button** (both users joined)
3. **Guest taps "Start Browse"**
4. **LobbyScreen checks:** GET /session/:id/deck
5. **200 OK returned** (deck already exists from host)
6. **Navigate to DeckScreen** (no POST needed)
7. **DeckScreen fetches:** GET /session/:id/deck
8. **Same deck loaded** (deterministic order from seed)
9. **Guest sees same places as host** (same order)
10. **Guest swipes independently**
    - Progress tracked separately
    - Swipes not synced in real-time (yet - S-503)
11. **Guest completes deck**
12. **Back to lobby**

---

### Flow 3: Button Fallback (No Swipe Gesture)

1. **User in DeckScreen** (cards loaded)
2. **User doesn't want to swipe** (accessibility, preference, etc.)
3. **User taps ‚úó button** (bottom left)
   - Same animation as swipe left
   - Card flies off left
   - Red overlay shown
   - Next card appears
4. **User taps ‚ô• button** (bottom right)
   - Same animation as swipe right
   - Card flies off right
   - Green overlay shown
   - Next card appears
5. **Works identically to swipe gestures**

---

### Flow 4: Spring-Back (Incomplete Swipe)

1. **User drags card 20% to the right**
   - Card tilts slightly
   - Green overlay at ~50% opacity
2. **User releases** (below 40% threshold)
3. **Card springs back to center**
   - Bouncy animation
   - No swipe registered
4. **Card remains** (same place, ready to swipe again)

---

## API Integration

### Endpoints Used

#### GET /api/v1/session/:id/deck (NEW)

**Purpose:** Retrieve deck for browsing

**Used By:** DeckScreen on mount

**Response Schema:**
```typescript
{
  session_id: string;
  deck: Array<{
    place_id: string;
    name: string;
    photo_url: string;
    category: "Restaurant" | "Bar" | "Cafe" | "Activity";
    rating: number | null;
    review_count: number;
    address: string;
    distance_km: number;
    order: number;
  }>;
  deck_seed: string;
  total_count: number;
}
```

**Error Handling:**
- 404: Deck not generated ‚Üí Retry 3 times
- 403: Not a session member ‚Üí Back to lobby
- 500: Server error ‚Üí Show error message

---

#### POST /api/v1/session/:id/deck (EXISTING - S-501)

**Purpose:** Generate new deck

**Used By:** LobbyScreen when deck doesn't exist

**Called:** Only if GET returns 404

**Response:** Same as GET endpoint

**Error Handling:**
- 400: Deck already exists ‚Üí Ignore (not an issue)
- 404: No places found ‚Üí Show alert
- 429: API quota ‚Üí Show alert
- 500: Server error ‚Üí Show alert

---

## Photo Loading from Google Places API

### Photo URL Format

```
https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/photo
  ?maxwidth=400
  &photoreference={photo_reference}
  &key={GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY}
```

### Photo Handling

1. **Valid Photo:**
   - Load from Google API URL
   - Display with `resizeMode="cover"`
   - 100% width/height of container

2. **Placeholder URL (via.placeholder.com):**
   - Show emoji placeholder instead
   - "üì∑ No photo available"

3. **Load Error:**
   - Console log error
   - Show placeholder
   - Don't crash UI

4. **Performance:**
   - Images cached by React Native
   - Lazy loaded as cards appear
   - Background cards also load photos (for smooth transitions)

---

## Performance Considerations

### Animation Performance

**Frame Rate:**
- Target: 60fps
- Achieved on physical devices (tested)
- Smooth swipe interactions

**Native Driver:**
- Used for opacity animations (overlays)
- NOT used for position/rotation (requires layout measurements)
- Trade-off: Smooth animations vs native performance

**Optimization Opportunities:**
- Could use React Native Reanimated 2 for better performance
- Would enable native driver for all animations
- Deferred to future polish sprint

---

### Memory Management

**Image Loading:**
- React Native caches images automatically
- Max 20-25 images loaded per session
- ~100KB per image (compressed from Google)
- Total: ~2-2.5MB per session (acceptable)

**Card Rendering:**
- Only renders visible cards (currentIndex and next 2-3)
- Cards already swiped return null (not rendered)
- Efficient for 20-25 card decks

**State Management:**
- Minimal state (deck array, currentIndex)
- No complex state calculations
- Fast re-renders

---

### Network Performance

**Deck Fetch:**
- Single GET request on mount
- ~40-60KB payload (JSON)
- Retry mechanism: Up to 3 retries (3 seconds max)

**Photo Loading:**
- Photos loaded lazily as needed
- ~10-20 photos visible during session
- Cached after first load
- Mobile data usage: ~2MB per session

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations (Acceptable for MVP)

1. **Swipes Not Submitted to Backend**
   - Swipes tracked locally but not saved
   - No match detection yet
   - Deferred to S-503 (Swipe Submission)

2. **No Real-Time Sync**
   - Users swipe independently
   - No coordination between host/guest
   - Can't see "other user is on card 5"
   - Deferred to future sprint (S-6XX)

3. **Console Error on Navigation**
   - Firestore race condition causes 404
   - Retry succeeds, but error still logged
   - Non-blocking, cosmetic issue
   - Could be fixed with better Firestore consistency handling

4. **Swipe Animations Not Optimal**
   - Using Animated API (JavaScript thread)
   - Could use Reanimated 2 (native thread) for 60fps guarantee
   - Current performance acceptable for MVP
   - Deferred to polish sprint

5. **No Undo/Rewind**
   - Once swiped, can't go back
   - Common Tinder feature
   - Not in MVP scope

6. **No Super Like**
   - Only like/nope (binary)
   - Could add third gesture (swipe up)
   - Future enhancement

---

### Technical Debt

1. **PanResponder vs Reanimated**
   - Using older Animated API
   - Should migrate to Reanimated 2 for better performance
   - Works well enough for MVP

2. **Photo Caching Strategy**
   - Relies on React Native's default caching
   - Could implement custom cache with TTL
   - Could preload next 5 photos
   - Low priority

3. **State Closure Issues**
   - Fixed with functional setState
   - Other places may have similar issues
   - Code review needed

4. **Error Handling Verbosity**
   - Some errors log to console but not user-facing
   - Could improve user messaging
   - Low priority

5. **Hardcoded Dimensions**
   - Screen width/height calculated once
   - Doesn't handle rotation
   - Should use onLayout for responsive design
   - Future enhancement
