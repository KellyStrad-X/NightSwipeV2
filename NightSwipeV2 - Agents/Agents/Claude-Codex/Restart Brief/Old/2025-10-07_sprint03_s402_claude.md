# Claude Restart Brief — Sprint 03: S-402 Complete

**Date:** 2025-10-07
**Sprint:** Sprint 03 - Invite Flow & Deck Mechanics
**Current Story:** S-402 — Invite Flow UI & Lobby States ✅ COMPLETE
**Status:** Ready for S-403, S-501, or S-502
**Developer:** Claude (Code Implementor)
**PM:** Codex

---

## Session Summary

Successfully implemented and tested **S-402: Invite Flow UI & Lobby States** end-to-end. Host can create sessions, share invite links, and wait in lobby. Guest can join via deep link (simulated with test button) and both users see real-time lobby updates via 2-second polling.

---

## What We Accomplished Today

### ✅ S-402 Implementation Complete

**New Components Created:**
1. **InviteModal** (`frontend/src/components/InviteModal.js`)
   - Shows host profile and join link
   - Copy link button (Expo Clipboard)
   - Share button (Expo Sharing API)
   - Displays join code visually

2. **LobbyScreen** (`frontend/src/screens/LobbyScreen.js`)
   - Host variant: "Waiting for guest..." → "Guest has joined!"
   - Guest variant: "Waiting for host to start..."
   - Real-time polling (2-second intervals)
   - Session status monitoring (expired, cancelled, active)
   - User slots showing host + guest states
   - "Start Browse" button (placeholder for S-501/S-502)
   - Cancel button (placeholder for S-403)

3. **Backend Endpoint** (`backend/src/routes/session.js`)
   - `GET /api/v1/session/by-code/:joinCode` - Look up session by join code

**Modified Files:**
- `frontend/src/screens/HomeScreen.js` - Integrated invite flow with session creation
- `frontend/App.js` - Added LobbyScreen to nav, auto-join flow for authenticated guests
- `frontend/src/context/AuthContext.js` - Updated to return pending join code (no alert)
- `frontend/src/services/api.js` - **MAJOR FIX:** Created proper API client with auth tokens
- `frontend/.env` - Fixed API URL to use correct IP and port

**Dependencies Installed:**
- `expo-sharing` - Native share sheet
- `expo-clipboard` - Clipboard API

### ✅ Infrastructure Fixes

1. **API Service Rewrite:**
   - Created default export `api` object with `.get()`, `.post()`, `.put()`, `.patch()`, `.delete()` methods
   - Automatically retrieves Firebase auth token from SecureStore
   - Adds `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header to all requests
   - Proper error handling with `error.response.status` and `error.response.data`

2. **Environment Configuration:**
   - Fixed frontend API URL: `http://192.168.1.181:3000` (was trying to hit Expo dev server on 8081)
   - API endpoints use `/api/v1` prefix (backend routes are under this namespace)
   - Added debug logging: `🔧 API Service initialized with URL: ...`

3. **Firestore Database Setup:**
   - Created Firestore database in **Native mode** (NOT Datastore mode)
   - Database name: `(default)` (required by Firebase Admin SDK)
   - Location: Selected by user (likely `us-central` or `us-east1`)
   - Mode: Test mode (allows all reads/writes for 30 days)
   - Cloud Firestore API enabled for project

### ✅ Testing Completed

**Successful End-to-End Flow:**
1. Host taps "Invite Someone" → Location requested → Session created in Firestore
2. InviteModal shows with join link: `https://nightswipe.app/join/{CODE}`
3. Copy link works (shows success alert)
4. Host navigates to lobby → Sees "Waiting for guest..."
5. Guest (simulated with test button) joins using join code
6. Host lobby updates after ~2 seconds (polling interval)
7. Host sees "Guest Name has joined!" ✅
8. Both users in lobby with correct display names

**Testing Method (Development):**
- Host device creates session, stays in lobby
- Manually update `LoginScreen.js` test code to real join code
- Guest device pulls changes, restarts Expo, taps 🧪 Test Link button
- Simulates deep link join flow (unauthenticated → login → auto-join → lobby)

### API Endpoints

**Session Endpoints (Backend: `/api/v1`):**
```
POST   /api/v1/session                  - Create new session (S-401)
GET    /api/v1/session/by-code/:code    - Lookup by join code (S-402) ✨ NEW
POST   /api/v1/session/:id/join         - Join existing session (S-401)
GET    /api/v1/session/:id              - Get session details (S-401)
PATCH  /api/v1/session/:id              - Update session (S-403 - TODO)
```

**Authentication:**
- All endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <firebase_token>`
- Token automatically retrieved from SecureStore by api service
- Verified by `verifyFirebaseToken` middleware

### Environment Variables

**Frontend (`.env`):**
```bash
# Correct configuration for physical device testing:
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://192.168.1.181:3000  # Host computer IP, backend port
EXPO_PUBLIC_ENV=development
```

**Backend (`.env`):**
```bash
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=nightswipe-7bb2a
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT={"type":"service_account",...}  # Full JSON
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_api_key  # TODO: Add for S-501
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:8081  # CORS config
```

### Firestore Database

**Project:** `nightswipe-7bb2a`
**Database:** `(default)` ← Must be named this for Admin SDK
**Mode:** Native mode (NOT Datastore mode)
**Security:** Test mode (30 days, allows all reads/writes)
**Status:** ✅ Ready, collections will be created automatically

**Collections (Auto-created):**
- `sessions/` - Session documents
  - `session_members/` - Subcollection for host/guest

**Schema:**
```javascript
sessions/{session_id}
{
  host_id: string,
  join_code: string (8-char hex),
  host_lat: number,
  host_lng: number,
  deck_seed: string | null,
  status: "pending" | "active" | "expired" | "cancelled",
  created_at: timestamp,
  updated_at: timestamp
}

sessions/{session_id}/session_members/{user_id}
{
  role: "host" | "guest",
  joined_at: timestamp
}
```

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations (Acceptable for MVP)

1. **SMS Invite Not Implemented**
   - Phone number field omitted from InviteModal
   - Twilio integration deferred to Sprint 03 backlog
   - Copy/share link serves as MVP solution

2. **Share Button UX**
   - `Sharing.shareAsync()` has platform-specific behavior
   - Currently uses clipboard copy + alert as fallback
   - Works but could be smoother

3. **Host Cancel Button**
   - UI present but PATCH endpoint not implemented
   - Shows placeholder alert when tapped
   - Deferred to S-403

4. **Session Expiry**
   - Frontend handles expired status via polling
   - Backend cron job for 30-min auto-expiry not implemented
   - Deferred to S-403

5. **Testing Deep Links**
   - Production URL `https://nightswipe.app` doesn't exist yet
   - Using test button with hardcoded join codes for development
   - Real deep links work in Expo Go with `exp://` scheme

### Technical Debt

1. **Polling Efficiency**
   - Every lobby instance polls independently every 2 seconds
   - Could use shared polling service or WebSocket
   - Low priority for MVP (1-2 concurrent sessions expected)

2. **Test Button Join Code**
   - Currently requires manual hardcoding of join code
   - `Alert.prompt()` is iOS-only (can't use for cross-platform input)
   - Fine for development, not needed in production

3. **API Error Messages**
   - Some errors are generic ("Request failed")
   - Could provide more specific user guidance
   - Improve based on user feedback

---

## Important Gotchas & Context

### Firestore Database Name
**CRITICAL:** Database MUST be named `(default)` for Firebase Admin SDK to find it. If you rename it, backend gets `5 NOT_FOUND` errors. We learned this the hard way!

### API URL Configuration
- **Port 3000** = Backend API ✅
- **Port 8081** = Expo dev server (JavaScript bundles) ❌
- Must use host computer's local network IP (e.g., `192.168.1.181`) for physical device testing
- `localhost` only works for web/emulator

### API Route Prefix
All backend routes are under `/api/v1` prefix. Frontend must use:
- `/api/v1/session` NOT `/session` ✅
- `/api/v1/session/by-code/:code` NOT `/session/by-code/:code` ✅

### Location Data Format
LocationContext returns:
```javascript
{ lat: number, lng: number }  // ✅ Correct
```
NOT:
```javascript
{ latitude: number, longitude: number }  // ❌ Wrong
```

### Testing Workflow (Two Devices)
1. Host creates session → **stays in lobby** (don't restart Expo!)
2. Note join code from lobby header
3. On host computer: Update `LoginScreen.js` with real join code
4. Guest device ONLY: Pull changes, restart Expo
5. Guest taps test button → Joins session
6. Host lobby updates after ~2 seconds

### Expo Environment Variables
Must restart Expo dev server for `.env` changes to apply. Simple reload won't work!

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate Options (Choose One)

**Option A: S-501 — Places Fetch & Normalization (P0, 12-16h)**
- Unblocks "Start Browse" button
- Google Places API integration
- Fetch 20-25 nearby restaurants/bars
- Normalize data for card UI
- Generate deterministic deck seed
- **Blocks:** S-502 (can't swipe without deck)

**Option B: S-502 — Swipeable Card UI (P0, 16-20h)**
- Requires S-501 to be done first (needs deck data)
- Implement swipe left/right gestures
- Card stack with visual feedback
- Button fallback controls
- Progress indicator
- **Blocks:** S-503 (swipe submission)

**Option C: S-403 — Session Lifecycle (P1, 8-12h)**
- Can be done independently
- Implement host cancel functionality
- 30-minute session timeout
- Guest rejoin logic
- Error state handling
- **Nice to have but not blocking**

### Recommended: Start with S-501 (Places Fetch)

**Why S-501 first:**
- P0 (launch blocking)
- Unblocks the "Start Browse" button in lobby
- Required before S-502 can be implemented
- Independent of S-403
- Involves Google Places API setup (takes time)

**S-501 Subtasks:**
1. Set up Google Places API key in backend `.env`
2. Create `POST /api/v1/session/:id/deck` endpoint
3. Implement Places Nearby Search API call
4. Normalize place data (name, photo, category, rating, etc.)
5. Generate deterministic deck seed
6. Implement distance calculation (Haversine)
7. Return shuffled deck (20-25 places)
8. Test with various locations

## Questions for PM (Codex)

1. **Priority for tomorrow:** S-501 (Places Fetch) or S-403 (Session Lifecycle)?
2. **Google Places API:** Do we have API key set up? Daily quota limits?
3. **Deck size:** Confirm 20-25 places per session? Radius 5km?
4. **Session timeout:** Confirm 30-minute expiry for S-403?
5. **Testing strategy:** Two-device testing sufficient or need more test accounts?

---

## Context for Next Session

**Current Sprint Goal:**
Complete S-501 (Places Fetch) and S-502 (Swipeable Cards) to enable full browse flow. S-403 (Session Lifecycle) is P1 and can be deferred if needed.

**Working Well:**
- API service architecture with auth tokens
- Firestore integration
- Real-time lobby polling
- Deep link simulation with test buttons

**Watch Out For:**
- Environment variables (require Expo restart)
- Firestore database name must be `(default)`
- API routes need `/api/v1` prefix
- Location data uses `lat/lng` not `latitude/longitude`

**Dev Environment:**
- Backend: Windows host computer, port 3000
- Frontend: Expo Go on physical device, connects to `192.168.1.181:3000`
- Database: Firestore Native mode, test mode enabled (30 days)
- Auth: Firebase Auth with tokens in SecureStore

---

**Status:** S-402 Complete ✅ | Sprint 03: 25% Complete | Ready for S-501 or S-403

**End of Restart Brief**
