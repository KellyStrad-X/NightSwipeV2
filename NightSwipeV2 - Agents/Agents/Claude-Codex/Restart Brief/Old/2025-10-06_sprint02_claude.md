## 3. Key Decisions & References

### Decisions Made This Session

1. **Targeted Fix Workflow Integration** - 2025-10-06
   - **Context:** User introduced TF workflow where GPT5 Codex creates fix documents, Claude implements and logs
   - **Process:**
     - Codex creates TF in `Sprints/Sprint_0X/Targeted Fix/`
     - Claude implements and logs in `TF Logs  - Claude/`
     - User moves TF to "Old" when complete
   - **Chosen:** Follow TF workflow for all production bugs
   - **Rationale:** Separates planned features (Sprint tasks) from reactive debugging (TFs)
   - **Logged:** All TFs documented in `TF Logs  - Claude/`

2. **Firestore Long-Polling Transport** - 2025-10-06
   - **Context:** Browser agent identified WebChannel transport failures in React Native
   - **Options considered:**
     A) Keep offline fallback only (workaround)
     B) Force long-polling transport (root cause fix)
     C) Auto-detect transport (let Firebase decide)
   - **Chosen:** Option B (force long-polling with auto-detect backup)
   - **Rationale:** React Native doesn't support WebSocket-based transports reliably; long-polling is proven to work
   - **Impact:** Eliminates "client is offline" errors on network-connected devices
   - **Logged:** `TF Logs  - Claude/2025-10-05_TF_location_timeout_and_firestore_transport.md`

3. **Location Timeout Strategy** - 2025-10-06
   - **Context:** 10-second timeout too aggressive for indoor/low-signal GPS
   - **Options considered:**
     A) Increase timeout only
     B) Add fallback to last-known position
     C) Add retry mechanism
     D) All of the above
   - **Chosen:** Option D (comprehensive resilience)
   - **Rationale:** Covers all failure modes - slow GPS, no history, user wants to retry
   - **Impact:** Users never stuck in error loop, can proceed with stale coordinates or retry
   - **Logged:** Same TF as above

- **TF Workflow:** All 4 TFs logged and ready for user to move to "Old" folder

---

## 4. Next Action Plan

### Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **User: Move Completed TFs to Old** - Est: 2 minutes (user action)
   - Action: Move these TFs to respective "Old" folders:
     - `TF_2025-10-05_offline_profile_fetch.md`
     - `TF_2025-10-05_location_timeout.md`
     - `TF_2025-10-06_firestore_reinit.md`
   - Files: TF documents in `Sprints/Sprint_02/Targeted Fix/`
   - Test: N/A

2. **Decision: S-203 or Sprint 03?** - Est: N/A (user decision)
   - Context: S-203 (deep linking) requires physical device testing
   - Options:
     A) Implement S-203 now (complete Sprint 02 fully)
     B) Defer S-203, move to Sprint 03 (lobby, deck, swiping)
   - Recommendation: Defer to Sprint 03 - deep linking can be added later without blocking core flow

3. **Mark Sprint 02 Complete** - Est: 5 minutes
   - Action: Update Sprint_02_Home_Location_Sessions.md with checkmarks
   - Files: `/Agents/Sprints/Sprint_02_Home_Location_Sessions.md`
   - Note: S-203 marked as deferred if user agrees

4. **Sprint 03 Planning** - Est: 10 minutes
   - Action: Review Sprint_03 tasks and acceptance criteria
   - Files: `/Agents/Sprints/Sprint_03_Invite_Lobby_Deck.md` (if exists)
   - Prepare for session/lobby implementation

### Testing Plan

**Already Tested:**
- ✅ Home screen animations (user confirmed smooth 60fps)
- ✅ Location permission flow (user confirmed working)
- ✅ Login/registration (user confirmed working)
- ✅ Firestore transport (user confirmed no more "client is offline")
- ✅ Hot reload (user confirmed Firebase reuse working)

**Future Testing (S-203 if implemented):**
- [ ] Deep link opens app from browser
- [ ] Deep link triggers auth flow if not logged in
- [ ] Deep link navigates to session lobby after auth
- [ ] Universal links work on iOS
- [ ] App scheme links work on Android

### Code Review Prep

Not applicable - all code tested and confirmed working by user.

**For future work:**
- [ ] Consider adding linter configuration
- [ ] Consider adding tests for critical flows
- [ ] Document Firestore schema in README

### Risks & Blockers

- **S-203 Device Testing** - Medium/Medium
  - Likelihood: High (requires physical device + URL testing)
  - Impact: Medium (feature can be added later without refactoring)
  - Mitigation: Defer to Sprint 03 or implement when user has dedicated testing time

- **Session Backend Untested** - Low/Low
  - Likelihood: Low (implementation follows spec exactly)
  - Impact: Low (can test with curl/Postman if needed)
  - Mitigation: User can test endpoints with Firebase token before building frontend UI

## 5. Stakeholder Notes

### Pending Questions

1. **S-203 Priority Decision** - For User
   - Context: Deep linking requires physical device testing, all other Sprint 02 work complete
   - Urgency: Nice to have (can defer to Sprint 03)
   - Recommendation: Defer S-203, move to Sprint 03 - allows progress on core features (lobby, deck, swiping)

2. **Session Join Code Length** - For User/PM
   - Context: Currently 8-character hex (e.g., "A3F9B21E")
   - Question: Is 8 characters ideal or should we shorten to 6 for easier sharing?
   - Impact: Security (longer = more unique) vs UX (shorter = easier to type)
   - Current: 8 chars = 4.3 billion possibilities (low collision risk)

3. **Session Expiration Policy** - For User/PM
   - Context: Sessions currently don't expire automatically
   - Question: Should we implement auto-expiration (e.g., 24 hours of inactivity)?
   - Impact: Database cleanup vs user convenience
   - Current: Manual cleanup or none (low priority for MVP)

### Commitments & Deadlines

- **Sprint 02 Core Features:** ✅ Complete (2025-10-06)
- **S-203 Target:** TBD (pending user decision)
- **Sprint 02 End:** Can mark complete if S-203 deferred
- **Sprint 03 Start:** Ready to begin immediately

### Communication Log

- **Last Update Sent:** 2025-10-06 - This restart brief
- **Last Feedback Received:** 2025-10-06 - "VERY WELL DONE - Both login & location are both functioning!"
- **Next Expected Feedback:** Decision on S-203 vs Sprint 03

---

## 8. Handoff Context

### For Incoming Agent

**If you're picking up this work:**

1. Read this brief top to bottom
2. Review Sprint 02 overview: `/Agents/Sprints/Sprint_02_Home_Location_Sessions.md`
3. Review implementation log: `/Agents/Claude-Codex/Logs/2025-10-05_s301_s302_s401_implementation.md`
4. Review TF logs to understand debugging fixes applied:
   - Offline profile fetch fallback
   - Location timeout handling
   - Firestore long-polling transport
   - Firestore hot reload reinitialization
5. Check for user decision on S-203 vs Sprint 03
6. Start with "Next Action Plan" section above

**Key Files to Review:**

- `frontend/src/screens/HomeScreen.js`: Animated home screen with location integration
- `frontend/src/context/LocationContext.js`: Location permission + timeout + fallback + retry
- `frontend/src/context/AuthContext.js`: Auth with offline profile fallback
- `frontend/src/config/firebase.js`: Long-polling transport + hot reload compatibility
- `backend/src/routes/session.js`: Session create/join/get endpoints
- `backend/src/server.js`: Session routes integrated

**Context:**

Sprint 02 core features (S-301, S-302, S-401) are complete and tested. Four Targeted Fixes applied to ensure production stability: offline login resilience, location timeout handling, Firestore transport fix, and hot reload compatibility. User confirmed "VERY WELL DONE" - all features functioning correctly. S-203 (deep linking) is the only remaining Sprint 02 task, pending user decision on whether to implement now or defer to Sprint 03.

**Critical Architecture Notes:**

1. **Firestore Transport:** MUST use `initializeFirestore()` with `experimentalForceLongPolling: true` for React Native compatibility. Do not use `getFirestore()` on first initialization.

2. **Firebase Reuse:** Always check `getApps().length` before calling `initializeApp()` to support Expo hot reload. Reuse existing instances when possible.

3. **Location Fallback Chain:**
   - Try fresh coordinates (15s timeout)
   - Fall back to last-known position (1-min max age)
   - Offer retry prompt if no fallback available
   - Never leave user stuck in loading state

4. **Auth Error Segregation:** Only fail auth operations on `auth/` errors. Firestore errors should use fallback data, not block authentication.

---

## 9. Session Retrospective

**What Went Well:**
- Rapid implementation of Sprint 02 features (~1 hour for 3 major tasks)
- Effective TF workflow - Codex identifies issues, Claude implements fixes
- Browser agent contribution (long-polling insight) was critical
- User testing provided immediate feedback - caught regressions quickly
- All fixes tested and confirmed working by user

**What Was Challenging:**
- Firestore reinitialization regression wasn't caught in VM (only manifests on hot reload)
- Location timeout required multiple layers (timeout, fallback, retry) to be truly resilient
- WebChannel transport issue was subtle - would have been hard to diagnose without browser agent

**Learnings:**
- **Firebase in React Native:** Always use long-polling transport, never assume WebChannel works
- **Expo Hot Reload:** Always check for existing Firebase instances before initializing
- **Error Handling Layers:** Need both root cause fixes (long-polling) AND fallbacks (offline profile) for true resilience
- **TF Workflow Value:** Separating reactive debugging from planned features keeps implementation logs clean
- **Console Logging Strategy:** Differentiate first-run vs reuse vs errors with clear prefixes (✅, ♻️, ❌)
