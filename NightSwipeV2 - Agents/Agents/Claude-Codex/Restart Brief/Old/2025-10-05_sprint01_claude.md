## 3. Key Decisions & References

### Decisions Made This Session

1. **Hybrid Firebase + Express Architecture** - 2025-10-05
   - **Context:** Original plan used PostgreSQL + custom JWT, but this adds significant complexity for MVP
   - **Options considered:**
     A) Full PostgreSQL + JWT (original plan)
     B) Full Firebase (Auth + Firestore + Cloud Functions)
     C) Hybrid (Firebase Auth + Firestore + Express backend)
   - **Chosen:** Option C (Hybrid)
   - **Rationale:** Firebase simplifies auth (~8 hour savings) while Express backend retains control over business logic (deck generation, match calculation)
   - **Logged:** `Agents/Backlog-Desicions/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`

### Important References

  - Current: `main`
  - Remote: `git@github.com:KellyStrad-X/NightSwipeV2.git`

- **Next Sync:** After user reviews PM summary and provides direction for S-102

---

## 4. Next Action Plan

### Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Wait for PM Review** - Est: User-driven
   - Action: User submits Claude Log to PM (Codex) for User Summary generation
   - Files: `/NS-CB/Logs/2025-10-05_sprint01_claude.md`
   - Test: N/A

2. **User: Create Firebase Project** - Est: 30-45 minutes (user action)
   - Action: Follow `/NS-CB/QUICKSTART.md` to set up Firebase
   - Dependencies: None
   - Output: Firebase credentials for .env files

3. **S-102: Sprint Ops & Logging Framework** - Est: 2-4 hours
   - Action: Create Restart Brief template structure, document check-in cadence
   - Files: Create logging workflow documentation
   - Test: Verify template is usable for future sessions

4. **S-201: Registration Flow** - Est: 8-12 hours
   - Action: Build registration screen with Firebase Auth integration
   - Dependencies: Firebase project setup complete
   - Files: Create `frontend/src/screens/RegisterScreen.js`, `frontend/src/context/AuthContext.js`
   - Test: Manual test registration on iOS/Android

### Testing Plan

**For S-102:**
- [ ] Verify Restart Brief template is clear and usable
- [ ] Document check-in cadence with Codex

**For S-201 (Future):**
- [ ] Unit tests for form validation
- [ ] Manual test on iOS via Expo Go
- [ ] Manual test on Android via Expo Go
- [ ] Edge cases: duplicate email, weak password, network failure

### Code Review Prep

Not applicable yet (no code changes pending review). Current code already committed to main.

**For future work:**
- [ ] Run linter: `npm run lint` (to be configured)
- [ ] Run tests: `npm test` (to be configured)
- [ ] Check .env not committed
- [ ] Update documentation if needed

### Risks & Blockers

- **Firebase Setup Dependency** - Medium/High
  - Likelihood: Low (straightforward process)
  - Impact: High (blocks S-201 and S-202)
  - Mitigation: QUICKSTART.md provides clear instructions; can proceed with S-102 in parallel

- **Node Version Warning** - Low/Low
  - Likelihood: Low (development working fine)
  - Impact: Low (may need update for production builds)
  - Mitigation: Update Node.js to 20.19.4+ when convenient; monitor for issues

---

## 5. Stakeholder Notes

### Pending Questions

1. **Firebase or Google Places API Priority?** - For User
   - Context: Both are pending setup. Which should user tackle first?
   - Urgency: Nice to have (can work on S-102 while user decides)
   - Recommendation: Firebase first (blocks S-201/S-202), Google API can wait until S-501 (Sprint 03)

2. **Check-in Cadence for S-102** - For Codex PM
   - Context: Need to define how frequently to sync with PM during Sprint 01
   - Urgency: Required for S-102 completion
   - Recommendation: End-of-session briefs, milestone check-ins after each backlog item completion

### Commitments & Deadlines

- **Sprint 01 Duration:** 1-2 weeks (original estimate)
- **S-101 Completion:** ✅ 2025-10-05 (completed)
- **S-102 Target:** TBD (awaiting user direction)
- **Sprint 01 End Target:** TBD (depends on Firebase setup timing)
- **External Dependencies:** Firebase project creation (user action)

### Communication Log

- **Last Update Sent:** 2025-10-05 - Claude Log created at `/NS-CB/Logs/2025-10-05_sprint01_claude.md`
- **Last Feedback Received:** N/A (first session)
- **Next Expected Feedback:** User summary from Codex PM after reviewing Claude Log

## 8. Handoff Context

### For Incoming Agent

**If you're picking up this work:**

1. Read this brief top to bottom
2. Review Sprint overview: `/Agents/Sprints/Sprint_01_Foundation_Auth.md`
3. Review architecture decision: `/Agents/Backlog-Desicions/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`
4. Check backlog item: S-102 (Sprint Ops & Logging Framework)
5. Review Claude Log: `/NS-CB/Logs/2025-10-05_sprint01_claude.md`
6. Check Git status: `cd /NS-CB && git status` (should be clean)
7. Start with "Next Action Plan" section above

**Key Files to Review:**

- `/NS-CB/backend/src/server.js`: Express server with health check endpoint
- `/NS-CB/frontend/App.js`: Development status screen with backend connectivity test
- `/NS-CB/frontend/src/config/firebase.js`: Firebase initialization (waiting for credentials)
- `/NS-CB/frontend/src/services/api.js`: Backend API communication helpers
- `/NS-CB/README.md`: Complete project documentation
- `/NS-CB/QUICKSTART.md`: Firebase setup instructions for user

**Context:**

S-101 (Dev Environment Setup) is complete. Backend and frontend are functional and tested. Firebase architecture has been decided and documented. All Sprint plans updated. Waiting for user to create Firebase project, then can proceed with S-102 (Ops Framework) in parallel with user's Firebase setup, followed by S-201/S-202 (auth implementation).

---

## 9. Session Retrospective

**What Went Well:**
- Backend and frontend setup completed smoothly with no blocking errors
- Git workflow established cleanly (no .env files committed)
- Comprehensive documentation created for future reference
- Architectural decision (Firebase hybrid) significantly simplifies Sprint 01
- Sprint documents updated efficiently to reflect architecture change

**What Was Challenging:**
- Large storyboard file (89K+ tokens) required reading in sections
- Sprint documents had multiple references to PostgreSQL/JWT that needed updating across several files
- Needed to design Firestore schema from scratch (no existing PostgreSQL schema to convert)

**Learnings:**
- Expo creates its own .git directory, needs removal to integrate into monorepo
- Firebase architecture reduces auth implementation from ~24 hours to ~16 hours (8-hour savings)
- Clear separation between what Firebase handles (auth, database) vs Express (business logic) keeps architecture flexible
- Comprehensive logging (Claude Log + iteration log + Restart Brief) ensures smooth handoffs
