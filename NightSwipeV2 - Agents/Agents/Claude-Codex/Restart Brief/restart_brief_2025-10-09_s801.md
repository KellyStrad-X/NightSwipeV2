# Restart Brief - October 9, 2025
## S-801: Splash Screen & Unified Home Experience

**Agent**: Claude-Codex
**Session Date**: October 9, 2025
**Sprint**: Sprint 05 (Polish & Quality)
**Story Completed**: S-801 - Splash screen with moon swipe animation
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implementation Complete, Ready for Testing

---

## üìã Session Summary

Implemented S-801 (splash screen with animated moon sequence) and completely redesigned the home screen UX to provide a unified experience for both logged-in and logged-out users. This eliminates jarring authentication routing and creates a smooth, cohesive user flow.

---

## üéØ What Was Accomplished

### 1. **S-801: Splash Screen Implementation**

Created a beautiful animated splash sequence with two variants:

**Cold Start (First launch or > 5 min since last close):**
1. Full moon logo fades in SLOWLY (1.2s) with scale effect
2. Breathing glow appears behind moon (2 breath cycles, ~3.2s total)
3. Moon swipes LEFT off screen + NightSwipe crescent logo slides in from RIGHT (simultaneous, 800ms)
4. Brief hold (500ms)
5. **Total duration: ~6.9 seconds**

**Warm Start (< 5 min since last close):**
1. NightSwipe crescent logo fades in quickly (600ms)
2. Brief hold (800ms)
3. **Total duration: ~1.4 seconds**

**Location**: `App.js` - Runs at root level BEFORE auth routing

**Technical Details**:
- Uses React Native Animated API with `useNativeDriver: true` for 60fps
- AsyncStorage tracks last app close time (`@nightswipe_last_close`)
- AppState listener saves timestamp when app is backgrounded
- 5-minute threshold for warm/cold detection (`WARM_START_THRESHOLD`)

### 2. **Unified Home Screen Experience**

**Major UX Change**: Instead of routing logged-out users to a separate LoginScreen, ALL users now land on the same HomeScreen with contextual UI.

**Entry Animation** (runs after splash completes):
- NightSwipe logo slides up (800ms, 80px distance)
- Content fades in below (600ms with 400ms delay)

**For Logged-Out Users**:
- "Start Searching" button ‚Üí Shows alert: "You need to be logged in to start searching!"
- User status indicator: üî¥ Red user icon + "log in" (white text, clickable)
- Clicking "log in" shows **inline login form**:
  - Email & password fields
  - "Log In" button with loading state
  - "Don't have an account? Register" link
  - "Cancel" button
  - KeyboardAvoidingView for iOS/Android compatibility

**For Logged-In Users**:
- "Start Searching" button ‚Üí Expands to Invite/Browse options
- User status indicator: üîµ Blue user icon + username (white text, static for now)
- Dev/logout buttons in top right corner

**Footer**: "Swipe. Decide. Go." callsign logo (fades in with entry animation)

**Location**: `HomeScreen.js` (src/screens/HomeScreen.js)

### 3. **Navigation Architecture Update**

**Before**: Auth-based routing - LoginScreen for logged-out, HomeScreen for logged-in
**After**: Universal routing - HomeScreen for everyone, context-aware UI

**App.js Navigation Changes**:
- Removed conditional auth routing (`{currentUser ? ... : ...}`)
- HomeScreen is now the default screen for all users
- Kept RegisterScreen for registration flow
- Removed LoginScreen from stack (login is now inline)

---

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Testing Cold Start Animation

**Method 1: Dev Button** (Recommended)
1. Tap the blue **"‚ùÑÔ∏è Cold Start"** button in top right
2. Force-close the app (swipe away from recent apps)
3. Reopen the app
4. Expected console output:
   ```
   üßä [DEV] Force cold start enabled - clearing flag
   üé¨ [DEBUG] Starting splash animation - warmStart: false
   ‚ùÑÔ∏è Running COLD start animation (full moon sequence)
   ```

**Method 2: Wait 5+ Minutes**
1. Close the app
2. Wait > 5 minutes
3. Reopen
4. Should trigger cold start automatically

**Method 3: First Install**
- Uninstall and reinstall the app
- First launch is always cold start

### Testing Warm Start Animation
1. Open app
2. Background it (don't force close)
3. Reopen within 5 minutes
4. Expected console output:
   ```
   üöÄ Warm start detected (Xs since close)
   ‚ö° Running WARM start animation
   ```

### Testing Inline Login
1. Open app while logged out
2. Should see red user icon + "log in"
3. Tap "log in" ‚Üí Inline form appears
4. Enter credentials ‚Üí Logs in without navigation
5. User icon turns blue, shows username

### Testing Auth Gate
1. While logged out, tap "Start Searching"
2. Should see alert: "You need to be logged in to start searching!"
3. After login, tap "Start Searching"
4. Should expand to Invite/Browse options

---

## üîß Technical Implementation Notes

### AsyncStorage Keys
- `@nightswipe_last_close` - Timestamp of last app close (for warm/cold detection)
- `@nightswipe_force_cold_start` - Flag to force cold start on next launch (dev testing)

### Animation Architecture
- **App.js**: Handles splash animation (pre-auth)
- **HomeScreen.js**: Handles entry animation (post-splash, logo slide-up)
- Both use `useNativeDriver: true` for performance

### Auth Flow
- Firebase auth handled by `AuthContext`
- Login method: `login(email, password)` returns Promise
- No navigation on login - UI updates reactively via `currentUser` state

### Race Condition Fix
The `startSplashAnimation` function now receives `warmStart` as a parameter instead of reading from state, preventing race conditions between setState and animation start.

---

## üö® Known Issues / Gotchas

### 1. **AppState Listener Interference**
- The AppState listener saves a timestamp when the app is backgrounded
- This interfered with testing by always creating a "recent" close time
- **Solution**: Added `FORCE_COLD_START_KEY` flag that persists through backgrounding

### 2. **Logo Positioning**
- Initial slide distance was too high (150px)
- Reduced to 80px to keep logo visible and balanced
- User feedback: "slides a bit too high in the header"

### 3. **Breathing Glow Size**
- Started at `width * 0.6` (way too big)
- Reduced to `width * 0.4` (still too big)
- Final: `width * 0.37` (just slightly bigger than moon)

### 4. **Text Color on User Status**
- Initially matched icon color (red for logged out, blue for logged in)
- Changed to white for both states per user request
- Improves readability and consistency

## üéØ Next Steps for New Agent

### Immediate Testing Priorities
1. Test cold start animation with dev button
2. Test warm start animation (< 5 min)
3. Test inline login flow
4. Test auth gate on "Start Searching"
5. Verify callsign logo appears in footer
6. Check all animations are smooth (60fps)

### If Issues Found
- Check console logs for debug output (extensive logging added)
- Verify AsyncStorage keys are being set/cleared correctly
- Confirm animation timings match spec (cold: ~6.9s, warm: ~1.4s)

### Next Story: S-902 (Analytics)
**Goal**: Set up analytics baseline with Firebase Analytics / Segment
- Track key user events (login, session creation, swipes, matches)
- Set up funnels for conversion tracking
- Dashboard for monitoring user engagement

**Reference**: See `restart_brief_2025-10-09.md` for full Sprint 05 details

### Next Story: S-802 (Button Microinteractions)
**Goal**: Add polish with fades and glows on button interactions
- Hover/press effects on all buttons
- Glow animations on primary actions
- Haptic feedback (if supported)

## üí¨ Key User Feedback & Decisions

### Design Decisions
1. **No Lottie**: User doesn't have After Effects assets, use React Native Animated
2. **Unified Home**: User wanted one screen for all users, not jarring auth routing
3. **Inline Login**: More UX friendly than separate login screen
4. **Callsign Logo**: "Swipe. Decide. Go." should be on every footer (started with home)

### User Quotes
- *"The Splash screen was way too fast"* ‚Üí Added slower moon fade-in + breathing glow
- *"It's jarring & not user friendly"* ‚Üí Redesigned to unified home screen
- *"The breathing background is like 3x the size, it looks weird"* ‚Üí Reduced glow to 37%
- *"It slides a bit too high in the header"* ‚Üí Reduced slide distance from 150px to 80px
- *"Can we make the username text & login text WHITE"* ‚Üí Changed from colored to white

### Technical Decisions
- **5-minute threshold** for warm start (adjustable if needed)
- **Force cold start flag** for dev testing (solves AppState interference)
- **Entry animation delay**: 200ms after splash completes (smooth transition)

---

## üìù Code Quality Notes

### Strengths
- Extensive console logging for debugging
- Clean separation: splash in App.js, entry in HomeScreen
- Proper useNativeDriver usage for performance
- KeyboardAvoidingView for mobile compatibility
- Race condition prevention with parameter passing

### Areas for Future Improvement
- Consider extracting splash animation to separate component
- Could add skip button for splash (user can tap to skip)
- Analytics events could be added to track warm/cold start ratio
- Haptic feedback on animations could enhance feel
