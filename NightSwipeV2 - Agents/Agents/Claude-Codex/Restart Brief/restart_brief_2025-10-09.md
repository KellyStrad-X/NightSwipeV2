## 🎊 Yesterday's Accomplishments (2025-10-08)

### **S-602: Host/Guest Match Logic & Load More - COMPLETE**

We crushed the final Sprint 04 story! Full two-user match coordination is now working end-to-end.

#### ✅ Backend Endpoints Added

**1. POST /api/v1/session/:id/calculate-match**
- Calculates intersection of right swipes (places BOTH users liked)
- Returns array of matched places with full details
- Updates session with `matches_calculated`, `match_count`, `matched_place_ids`
- Uses Set data structure for efficient intersection (scales to N users)

**2. POST /api/v1/session/:id/load-more-confirm**
- Tracks user confirmations for loading more places
- When all users confirm:
  - Deletes old swipes and deck
  - Fetches new places from Google API (5km/10km radius)
  - Generates new deck with different seed (different order)
  - Resets session state
  - Increments `load_more_count`
- Coordinates both users for seamless deck reload

**3. Updated GET /api/v1/session/:id**
- Added `load_more_count` and `matches_calculated` fields
- Allows frontend to poll for new deck without modifying state

#### ✅ Frontend Screens Created

**1. MatchFoundScreen.js** (260 lines)
- "IT'S A MATCH!" celebration header with 💫 emoji
- Horizontal carousel of matched places
- Same card design as DeckScreen (consistency)
- Tap any place → Navigate to MatchScreen for details
- "Back to Home" button

**2. NoMatchScreen.js** (108 lines)
- "No Matches Yet" 😕 empty state
- Clear message: "You didn't swipe right on the same places"
- "🔄 Load More Places" button (primary CTA)
- "Back to Home" fallback

**3. WaitingForConfirmScreen.js** (98 lines)
- "Waiting for others..." with ⏳ emoji
- Shows progress: "X of Y confirmed"
- Polls backend every 2 seconds watching for `load_more_count` increment
- Auto-navigates when new deck ready

#### ✅ DeckScreen Integration

**Updates to `DeckScreen.js`:**
- Solo mode detection (checks user count before setting quota)
- `calculateMatches()` function for match intersection
- Updated completion logic to call calculate-match when both users finish
- Enhanced swipe logging for debugging

#### ✅ Complete Two-User Flow Now Works

**Match Path (1+ matches):**
1. Both users swipe through deck
2. Both finish → Calculate matches
3. Navigate to "IT'S A MATCH!" screen
4. Show carousel of matched places
5. Tap place → See full details

**No-Match Path (0 matches):**
1. Both users swipe through deck
2. Both finish → Calculate matches (0 found)
3. Navigate to "No Matches Yet" screen
4. Host clicks "Load More" → Waiting screen
5. Guest clicks "Load More" → New deck generates
6. Both navigate to new deck automatically
7. Repeat until they find matches!

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed During S-602

### Bug #1: Endpoint Not Found (404)
**Problem:** Routes missing `/session` prefix
**Fix:** Changed `/:id/calculate-match` → `/session/:id/calculate-match`

### Bug #2: Solo Mode Intercepting Two-User Sessions
**Problem:** Quota being set for ALL sessions, triggering solo Results screen
**Fix:** Added user count check before setting quota (only for solo mode)

### Bug #3: Google Places API INVALID_REQUEST
**Problem:** Missing radius parameter in load-more deck fetch
**Fix:** Added `5000` (5km) radius with `10000` (10km) fallback

### Bug #4: Photos Not Loading in New Deck
**Problem:** Missing `apiKey` parameter in `normalizePlace()` call
**Fix:** Added API key to construct photo URLs properly

### Bug #5: Host Stuck on Waiting Screen
**Problem:** Polling POST endpoint repeatedly, but confirmations cleared after deck generation
**Fix:** Changed to poll GET endpoint, watch `load_more_count` increment instead

---

## 📊 Current State - SPRINT 04 COMPLETE! 🎉

### What Works Right Now (End-to-End)

**Solo Mode (Complete):**

2. Guest joins via invite link
3. Both users in lobby, see each other
4. Host clicks "Start Browse" → Generates deck
5. Guest clicks "Start Browse" → Gets same deck
6. Both swipe through cards (swipes sync to backend)
7. Both finish → Calculate matches
8. **1+ matches:** "IT'S A MATCH!" screen with carousel
9. Tap place → See details

**Two-User Mode - No Match + Load More (Complete):**
1. Follow steps 1-7 above
2. **0 matches:** "No Matches Yet" screen
3. Both tap "Load More Places"

## 🎯 Next Up: SPRINT 05 - Maps, Polish & Quality

**Sprint Goal:** Complete navigation integration, branding polish, and production-ready quality assurance

**Total Stories:** 6 (3 P0, 2 P1, 1 P2)
**Estimated Effort:** 44-68 hours (1-2 weeks)

### P0 Items (Launch Blocking)

#### **S-701: Deep Link to Apple/Google Maps** (6-8 hours)
**Goal:** Make "Maps Link" button work on Match screen

**What to Build:**
- iOS: Opens Apple Maps with place location
- Android: Opens Google Maps with place location
- Web fallback if maps app not installed
- Error handling with toast messages

**Implementation:**
```javascript
import { Linking, Platform } from 'react-native';

const openMaps = async (place) => {
  const { name, geometry } = place;
  const { lat, lng } = geometry.location;
  const encodedName = encodeURIComponent(name);

  const url = Platform.select({
    ios: `maps:///?q=${encodedName}&ll=${lat},${lng}`,
    android: `geo:${lat},${lng}?q=${encodedName}`
  });

  const supported = await Linking.canOpenURL(url);
  if (supported) {
    await Linking.openURL(url);
  } else {
    // Web fallback
    const webUrl = Platform.select({
      ios: `https://maps.apple.com/?q=${encodedName}&ll=${lat},${lng}`,
      android: `https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=${lat},${lng}`
    });
    await Linking.openURL(webUrl);
  }
};
```

**Files to Update:**
- `frontend/src/screens/MatchScreen.js` (currently has placeholder Alert)

**Testing:**
- iOS device → Apple Maps opens
- Android device → Google Maps opens
- Simulator/emulator → Web fallback works

---

#### **S-702: Session Restart & Deck Refresh** (8-12 hours)
**Goal:** Make "Restart" button work on Match screen

**What to Build:**

**Backend:**
- New endpoint: `POST /session/:id/restart`
- Deletes old swipes (or marks archived)
- Generates new deck_seed: `${sessionId}-${Date.now()}`
- Creates new deck (same location, new shuffle)
- Increments `restart_count`
- Returns new deck data

**Frontend:**
- Update MatchScreen "Restart" button
- Solo mode: Clear local state, fetch new deck, return to DeckScreen
- Two-user mode: Both users see "Starting new deck..." → Navigate together
- Reset swipe counters

**Coordination Pattern:**
- Similar to load-more-confirm flow
- Track restart confirmations in session doc
- When all confirm → Generate new deck
- Poll for deck readiness

**Files to Update:**
- `backend/src/routes/session.js` (add new endpoint)
- `frontend/src/screens/MatchScreen.js` (update restart handler)
- `frontend/src/screens/DeckScreen.js` (reset state on restart)
- May need new `WaitingForRestartScreen.js` (or reuse existing waiting screen)

---

#### **S-901: Error Handling & Offline States** (10-14 hours)
**Goal:** Robust error handling for production

**What to Build:**

**Offline Detection:**
- Install: `@react-native-community/netinfo`
- Show banner when offline: "You're offline. Some features won't work."
- Auto-dismiss when reconnected

**Error Handling:**
- Deck fetch fails → Show retry button
- Swipe submission fails → Queue locally, retry automatically
- Session expires → Show error, return to Home
- Token expires → Redirect to login
- Maps link fails → Show toast, attempt web fallback

**Retry Logic:**
- Swipe submission: 3 automatic retries with backoff
- Deck fetch: Manual retry button
- Session polling: Exponential backoff

**UI Components Needed:**
- OfflineBanner component
- ErrorModal component
- RetryButton component
- Toast messages (use library like `react-native-toast-message`)

**Files to Update:**
- All screens that make API calls
- New: `frontend/src/components/OfflineBanner.js`
- New: `frontend/src/components/ErrorModal.js`
- New: `frontend/src/utils/errorHandler.js` (centralized error handling)

---

### P1 Items (MVP Differentiator)

#### **S-801: Splash & Logo Animation** (6-10 hours)
**Goal:** Beautiful app launch experience

**What to Build:**
- Splash screen on app launch
- Animation sequence:
  1. Full moon logo appears (0s)
  2. Moon swipes left off screen (0.5-1s)
  3. Crescent "NightSwipe" logo fades in (1-1.5s)
  4. Hold 0.5s
  5. Transition to Home screen
- Dark gradient background with glow effect
- Total duration: 2-2.5 seconds
- Optional: Tap to skip

**Implementation Options:**
- Lottie animation (if assets available)
- React Native Animated API
- Reanimated 2 (better performance)

**Assets Needed:**
- Check `./Misc/Branding-Logos/` for moon logos
- May need to create or request assets

**Files to Create:**
- `frontend/src/screens/SplashScreen.js`
- Update `frontend/App.js` to show splash on launch

---

#### **S-902: Analytics & Logging Baseline** (8-12 hours)
**Goal:** Track key user events for product insights

**What to Build:**

**Key Events to Track:**
- `user_registered`, `user_logged_in`
- `session_created`, `invite_sent`, `guest_joined`
- `deck_started`, `swipe_completed`, `deck_finished`
- `match_found`, `no_match`, `restart_triggered`
- `map_link_opened`, `error_occurred`

**Implementation Options:**
- Custom endpoint: `POST /analytics/events`
- Segment (free tier)
- Mixpanel (free tier)
- Firebase Analytics (already have Firebase)

**Privacy:**
- No PII (email, phone numbers)
- Anonymized user IDs
- Document what's collected

**Files to Create:**
- `backend/src/routes/analytics.js` (if custom)
- `frontend/src/utils/analytics.js` (track function)
- Backend logging with Winston or similar

---

### P2 Item (Nice-to-Have)

#### **S-802: CTA & Gem Glow Microinteractions** (6-8 hours)
**Goal:** Polish button animations

**What to Build:**
- "Start Searching" button fades out when tapped
- "Invite"/"Start Browse" buttons fade in
- Subtle glow effect on primary buttons
- 300ms transitions

**Note:** Can defer to post-MVP if Sprint 05 runs long

  - `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` already configured
  - Firebase credentials already set

---

## 🐛 Known Issues (None Critical!)

### Minor Notes:
1. **Load-more confirmations race condition** (low probability)
   - Two users confirming simultaneously could lose one confirmation
   - Mitigated by: Low probability with 2 users
   - Proper fix: Firestore transactions (can do in S-901)

2. **Same places in new deck**
   - Load-more fetches from same location, returns mostly same places
   - Different shuffle order provides some variety
   - Future: Use Google Places `pageToken` for next page of results

3. **No timeout on waiting screen**
   - If one user leaves, other stuck waiting
   - Workaround: "Back to Home" button
   - Can add timeout in S-901

4. **No session recovery after app restart**
   - User loses session context if app closes
   - Future: Store last_session_id in AsyncStorage

## 🚀 Quick Start for Next Session

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Start backend (in one terminal on HOST machine)
cd /path/to/NS-CB/backend
npm start

# Start frontend (in another terminal on HOST machine)
cd /path/to/NS-CB/frontend
npx expo start
```

### 2. Code Location
**VM (where Claude edits):**
- `/home/linuxcodemachine/Desktop/NS-CB/`

**Host (where you test):**
- Your local NS-CB directory (pull from Git)

**Remember:** Code changes in VM need to be pushed to Git, then pulled on host!

### 3. Testing Current State (Optional Smoke Test)

**Two-User Match Flow:**
1. Device 1: Login → "Start Searching" → "Invite Someone"
2. Share invite link to Device 2
3. Device 2: Open link → Join session
4. Both in lobby → Click "Start Browse"
5. Swipe through deck, intentionally match on 2-3 places
6. Both finish → "IT'S A MATCH!" screen
7. See matched places in carousel

**No-Match + Load More Flow:**
1. Follow steps 1-4 above
2. Swipe through deck, intentionally DON'T match
3. Both finish → "No Matches Yet" screen
4. Both click "Load More Places"
5. First user → "Waiting for others..."
6. Second user clicks → Both navigate to new deck
7. Swipe again!

### 4. Start Sprint 05 Implementation

**Recommended Order:**
1. **S-701 (Maps)** - Quick win, adds immediate value
2. **S-702 (Restart)** - Similar pattern to load-more
3. **S-901 (Errors)** - Critical for production
4. **S-902 (Analytics)** - Track usage
5. **S-801 (Splash)** - Polish
6. **S-802 (Microinteractions)** - Only if time

## 💡 Tips for Sprint 05

### 1. S-701 Maps Deep Link
- Test on real devices (simulator doesn't have maps apps)
- URL encoding is critical for place names with spaces/special chars
- `Linking.canOpenURL()` is async, await it!
- Web fallback ensures it always works

### 2. S-702 Restart Flow
- Can reuse load-more confirmation pattern
- Similar coordination: track confirmations, poll for completion
- Key difference: Restart from match screen, not no-match screen
- Consider: Should restart require confirmation or be instant?

### 3. S-901 Error Handling
- Start with offline detection (easiest)
- Add retry logic to existing API calls
- Centralized error handler keeps code DRY
- Toast messages better than alerts for non-blocking errors

### 4. S-902 Analytics
- Firebase Analytics already installed (part of Firebase SDK)
- Easiest option: Use built-in Firebase Analytics
- Alternative: Custom endpoint if you want more control
- Don't track PII!

### 5. S-801 Splash Screen
- Expo has built-in splash screen support
- Keep animation short (2-3 seconds max)
- Users will see this every launch, don't annoy them
- Skip on tap is highly recommended
