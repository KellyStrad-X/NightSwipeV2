# Restart Brief – Codex (GPT-5)

**Prepared:** 2025-10-07 23:58 UTC  
**Branch:** `Sprint_03_Implementations`  
**Sprint:** Sprint 04 – Swipe Sync & Match Logic  
**Session Duration:** ~4h (Solo wrap)

---

## 1. Current Objective
- Land the solo completion loop (S-601) so users can see their picks after swiping.
- Stage groundwork for two-user match logic and restart flows in S-602/S-702.

**Status Snapshot**
- ✅ S-601 Solo Results & Match detail shipped (quota, carousel, detail view).
- ✅ Home screen solo CTA now spins its own session + deck and drops into DeckScreen.
- ✅ S-503 swipe submission/status APIs in place and exercised in solo flow.
- ⏳ S-602 match intersection + two-user results.
- ⏳ S-701 Maps deep link + S-702 restart deck refresh.

## 2. Latest Changes
| Area | Update | Files |
|------|--------|-------|
| Solo CTA | Start Browse creates solo session, generates deck, navigates immediately | `frontend/src/screens/HomeScreen.js` |
| DeckScreen | Tracks right swipes, enforces 3–6 quota, navigates to results, trims debug logging | `frontend/src/screens/DeckScreen.js` |
| Results View | New carousel of liked places with empty state & back navigation | `frontend/src/screens/ResultsScreen.js` |
| Match Detail | Full-screen detail for a liked place with placeholder actions | `frontend/src/screens/MatchScreen.js` |
| Backend Logs | Removed noisy swipe/status console logs post S-503 | `backend/src/routes/session.js` |

## 3. Outstanding Items / Risks
1. **Two-user match logic (S-602)**  
   - Need intersection of host/guest right-swipes + match screen.  
   - Requires backend query or on-the-fly aggregation.  
   - Blocker: decide storage/query pattern (reuse Firestore swipes vs new collection).

2. **Maps deep link & restart hooks (S-701/S-702)**  
   - Buttons currently emit placeholder alerts.  
   - Need platform-specific Linking with coordinates + session reset flow.  
   - Ensure restart clears deck + status + swipes server-side.

3. **Swipe retry queue / offline support**  
   - Failed submissions only log; no persistence.  
   - Should enqueue in AsyncStorage and flush (stretch goal but note).

4. **Solo quota UX polish**  
   - Quota count only in logs; consider on-screen progress indicator.  
   - Provide messaging when quota met vs deck exhausted.

5. **Match analytics / telemetry**  
   - No tracking for quota hits, results taps, etc.  
   - Add events once flow stabilizes.

---

## 4. Next Action Plan (Tomorrow)
1. **Design S-602 data flow (30m)**  
   - Decide on backend endpoint: e.g. `GET /session/:id/matches` returning common right-swipes.  
   - Sketch Firestore queries (compound index on session_id + direction).  
   - Document plan in log before implementation.

2. **Implement S-602 backend + frontend (2–3h)**  
   - Backend: compute intersection, persist match result (optional).  
   - Frontend: poll once both users complete, then navigate to new MatchResults screen.  
   - Reuse ResultsScreen cards where possible.

3. **Hook Maps link placeholder (S-701 lite) (45m)**  
   - Use `Linking.openURL` with `https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=<lat>,<lng>` once lat/lng available.  
   - Fallback alert if coords missing.

4. **Prep restart flow requirements (30m)**  
   - Outline backend mutations needed to clear deck/swipes.  
   - Identify UI entry points (MatchScreen button, home CTA).

5. **QA Pass (ongoing)**  
   - Solo flow: Start Browse → quota → Results → Match → Back to Home.  
   - Ensure deck generation handles quota even when fewer than quota results exist.

## 5. Environment Notes
- Repo clean on `Sprint_03_Implementations` (ahead of remote).  
- Backend requires valid `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` in `backend/.env`.  
- Start commands:  
  ```bash
  # Backend
  cd backend && npm run dev

  # Frontend
  cd frontend && npx expo start
  ```
- Test device: Expo Go (iOS/Android). Solo flow only exercises one device.  
- Logs trimmed; enable verbose by reintroducing local console statements if needed.

**Ready for next session:** Finalize S-602 match sync plan, implement match results, and wire upcoming Maps/restart actions. Clean solo flow is in place for demo/testing.
