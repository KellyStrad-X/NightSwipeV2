# Restart Brief – Codex

**Prepared:** 2025-10-05 18:30 UTC
**Prepared By:** Codex (PM)
**Sprint:** Sprint 01 – Foundation & Authentication
**Session Duration:** ~3h (coordination, repo audit, env setup review)

---

## 1. Current Objective

### Primary Goal
Coordinate Sprint 01 hand-off: confirm environment + architecture pivots, capture status for Firebase-ready auth work, and align next actions before Claude resumes.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Firebase + Google Places credentials stored locally (not in git).
- [x] Backlog/sprint docs reflect Firebase architecture decision.
- [x] User summary delivered for stakeholders.

**Backlog Reference:** Agents/Backlog-Desicions /NightSwipe_MVP_Backlog_Draft.md (S-101, S-102, S-201, S-202)

## 2. Latest Status

### Completed This Session
1. **Firebase & Places Credentials Validated (VM copy removed)** – Temporarily inserted service-account + API key to `../NS-CB/backend/.env` for verification, then deleted the file once the host stored the secrets; verified `.gitignore` coverage; ran clean git status.
   - Files touched: `../NS-CB/backend/.env`
   - Notes: Secrets now exist only on host; VM keeps `.env.example` template.

2. **Backlog & Decision Review** – Validated ADR-001 and sprint updates for Firebase shift; confirmed backlog canonical path.
   - Docs touched: `Agents/Backlog-Desicions /Changes-Decisions/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`, `Agents/Backlog-Desicions /Changes-Decisions/SPRINT_UPDATES_FIREBASE.md`

3. **User Summary Published** – `User/User Summaries/2025-10-05_mvp_progress_summary.md` captures scope, decisions, next steps.

4. **Repo Clean-up** – Removed misplaced `Logs/` folder; committed `chore: remove stray logs directory` (pushed).

**Total Progress:** Sprint 01 S-101 complete; S-102 ready to start once Claude is on.

### Outstanding Subtasks
- [ ] **S-102 – Sprint Ops & Logging Framework** – Owner: Codex/Claude; Est: 2-4h. Needs restart brief cadence + log directories aligned with new structure.
- [ ] **S-201 – Registration Flow (Firebase)** – Owner: Claude; Est: 8-12h. Depends on Firebase creds (now available).
- [ ] **S-202 – Login & Session (Firebase)** – Owner: Claude; Est: 8-12h. Requires auth context + SecureStore.

### Known Issues
- **Node version < Expo recommendation**
  - Severity: Low
  - Current: v20.11.1; Expo asks for ≥20.19.4. No immediate breakage.
  - Next steps: plan upgrade before release builds.

## 3. Key Decisions & References

### Decisions Made This Session
1. **Secret Management Approach** – 2025-10-05
   - **Context:** Needed Firebase + Places keys without polluting git or leaving them in the VM.
   - **Chosen:** Populate host-only `.env`; use templates (`.env.example`) in repo for reference; remove VM copies after validation.
   - **Rationale:** Keeps secrets off repo and out of shared environment while unblocking engineering.
   - **Logged:** This brief (host retains `.env`; VM holds template only).

### Important References
- **Code Branches:**
  - Current: `main` (clean, ahead synced)
  - Base: `origin/main`
- **Documentation:**
  - MVP spec: `Misc/NightSwipe MVP Overall.md`
  - Auth flow: `Misc/NightSwipe MVP Auth Flow.md`
  - ADR: `Agents/Backlog-Desicions /Changes-Decisions/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`
- **Assets:**
  - Branding: `Misc/Branding-Logos/`
  - Guides: `User/Guides/`

### Coordination Notes
- **Codex Review:** Up-to-date
- **Last Sync:** 2025-10-05 with user
- **Next Sync:** After Claude posts Sprint 01 log / restart brief post-reset

## 4. Next Action Plan

### Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **Claude S-102 Kickoff** – Align restart brief + logging cadence; ensure `Agents/Claude-Codex/Logs/` structure stays canonical.
2. **Implement S-201 Registration UI** – Firebase Auth integration once Claude’s reset occurs.
3. **Implement S-202 Login + Persistence** – SecureStore tokens, auth context, logout flow.

### Testing Plan
- [ ] Backend Firebase Admin init smoke test after Claude wires middleware.
- [ ] Expo app login/registration manual test on iOS & Android once implemented.
- [ ] Verify backend `/health` post-changes.

### Code Review Prep
- [ ] Run linter/tests once implemented (tbd when code lands).
- [ ] Update docs if onboarding steps change.

### Risks & Blockers
- **Firebase auth work pending** – Likelihood: Medium (depends on Claude’s availability). Impact: High. Mitigation: Share this brief + user summary; Claude resumes post-reset.

## 5. Stakeholder Notes

### Pending Questions
1. **Backend Hosting Target** – Need confirmation on deployment platform before Sprint 03.

### Commitments & Deadlines
- **Sprint End:** TBD (target 1-2 weeks cadence).
- **Next Demo:** After Sprint 02 (Home + Sessions).

### Communication Log
- **Last Update Sent:** User summary 2025-10-05.
- **Last Feedback Received:** Architecture decision approval (today).

## 6. Environment & Setup

### Current Development Setup
- **Branch:** `main`
- **Node Version:** 20.11.1 (needs bump later)
- **Expo SDK:** Default from fresh init (tbd exact version)
- **Key Dependencies:** `firebase`, `firebase-admin`, `expo-secure-store`, `express`

### Testing Setup
- **Expo Go:** User to confirm latest version on devices.
- **Test Devices:** Not yet logged; to collect when Claude runs manual QA.

### Environment Variables
- **Firebase Admin:** Host-only `.env` (VM copy removed; see `.env.example` for template).
- **Google Places Key:** Host-only `.env` (same approach).
- **Frontend Firebase Config:** Pending user entry (app shows warning until added; host will populate its `.env`).

---

## 7. Code Quality Checklist
- [x] All code committed
- [x] Commit message follows convention
- [x] No merge conflicts
- [x] Secrets ignored by git
- [ ] Linter/tests pending (no new code yet)

---

## 8. Handoff Context

**For Incoming Agent (Claude):**
1. Read this brief + user summary.
2. Verify Firebase client config in `frontend/.env` before auth screens.
3. Start with S-102 tasks; then tackle S-201 / S-202 in order.

**Key Files to Review:**
- `../NS-CB/backend/.env.example` – ensure template stays updated if variables change.
- `../NS-CB/frontend/App.js` – baseline status UI; will expand during auth work.

**Context:** Firebase-first architecture is locked; secrets live only on the host machine, with templates in repo. Auth implementation is next critical milestone.

---

## 9. Session Retrospective (Optional)

**What Went Well:**
- Secrets configured safely without touching git.
- Architecture documentation synced with backlog.

**What Was Challenging:**
- Sandbox network restrictions blocked git push (user pushed manually).

**Learnings:**
- Maintain ADR + sprint docs in `Agents/Backlog-Desicions /` for clarity.
