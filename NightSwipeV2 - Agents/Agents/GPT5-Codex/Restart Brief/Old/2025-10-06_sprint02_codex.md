# Restart Brief – Codex

**Prepared:** 2025-10-06 05:20 UTC
**Prepared By:** Codex (GPT-5)
**Sprint:** Sprint 02 – Home, Location & Session Infrastructure
**Session Duration:** ~6.5h (multi-agent collaboration + TFs)

---

## 1. Current Objective

### Primary Goal
Stabilize Sprint 02 implementations (home screen, location flow, session APIs) so mobile auth, location acquisition, and Firebase persistence function reliably after the latest fixes. Prep hand-off for next-session work on invites and deck fetching.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Login returns real profile data after hot reload (Firestore reuse fix).
- [x] Location flow tolerates slow GPS and provides fallback/ retry UX.
- [ ] Session endpoints validated with host/guest tokens (pending multi-device test).
- [ ] Invite/deck UI remains stubbed; to be implemented next session.

**Backlog Reference:** `Agents/Backlog-Desicions /NightSwipe_MVP_Backlog_Draft.md` (S-301, S-302, S-401), TF briefs `TF_2025-10-05_offline_profile_fetch.md`, `TF_2025-10-05_location_timeout.md`, `TF_2025-10-06_firestore_reinit.md`.

## 2. Latest Status

### Completed This Session
1. **Auth Offline Fallback (TF)** – Added `fetchUserProfile` helper, fallback profile data, and resilient register/login flows so auth works offline. Logged output: `Agents/Targeted Fix/TF Logs  - Claude/2025-10-05_TF_offline_profile_fetch.md`.
   - Files touched: `frontend/src/context/AuthContext.js`
   - Status: ✅ Pushed (`fix: allow auth login when firestore offline`).

2. **Location Timeout + Fallback (TF)** – Rewrote `LocationContext` to use Expo timeout, last-known fallback, and retry prompt. Added long-polling Firestore init. Documented in `Agents/Targeted Fix/TF Logs  - Claude/Old/2025-10-05_TF_location_timeout_and_firestore_transport.md`.
   - Files touched: `frontend/src/context/LocationContext.js`, `frontend/src/config/firebase.js`
   - Status: ✅ Pushed (`fix: auth fix (firebase) + locationserv. fix`).

3. **Firestore Reinitialization (TF)** – Reused Firebase app + Firestore across hot reloads so profiles sync correctly. Log: `Agents/Targeted Fix/TF Logs  - Claude/2025-10-06_TF_firestore_reinit.md`.
   - Files touched: `frontend/src/config/firebase.js`
   - Status: ✅ Pushed (`fix: Firebase Auth user-sync fix`).

4. **Sprint 02 Infrastructure** – Branch `sprint_02_implementations` now holds home screen animation, location context, session backend endpoints, and long-polling-compatible Firestore startup.
   - Branch status: ahead of `origin/main`, ready for future PR once QA completes deck/invite flows.

**Total Progress:** Sprint 02 infrastructure is functionally complete for auth + location + session API. Remaining features (invite UI, deck fetching) scheduled for next session.

### Outstanding Subtasks
- [ ] **Session API QA (host/guest tokens)** – Owner: Codex; Est: 1h. Verify `POST /session`, `POST /session/:id/join`, `GET /session/:id` with real Firebase tokens on host machine.
- [ ] **Invite Modal & Deck Fetch (S-401/S-501)** – Owner: Claude (next session); Est: 6-8h. Depends on session QA above.
- [ ] **SafeAreaView migration** – Owner: Codex/Claude; Est: 0.5h. Replace deprecated RN `SafeAreaView` with `react-native-safe-area-context` in home screen.

### Known Issues
- **Expo Auth Persistence Warning**
  - Severity: Low. Firebase warns that AsyncStorage persistence is missing.
  - Next steps: add `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` + `initializeAuth` in a future task.

- **Start Browse CTA still stubbed**
  - Severity: Low. Logs location and awaits deck flow.
  - Next steps: implement deck fetch in Sprint 03.

## 3. Key Decisions & References

### Decisions Made This Session
1. **Force Firestore Long-Polling + Reuse Instances** – 2025-10-05/06
   - **Context:** WebChannel transport breaks under Expo; hot reload duplicated Firestore init.
   - **Chosen:** Force `experimentalForceLongPolling` + reuse existing app/firestore via `getApp()/getFirestore()`.
   - **Rationale:** Keeps location/auth TFs working reliably in dev and production.
   - **Logged:** TF logs (`2025-10-05_TF_location_timeout_and_firestore_transport.md`, `2025-10-06_TF_firestore_reinit.md`).

2. **Location Timeout UX** – 2025-10-05
   - **Context:** Location requests timed out indoors.
   - **Chosen:** Built-in Expo timeout + fallback to last-known + retry prompt.
   - **Rationale:** Keeps users unblocked with graceful feedback.
   - **Logged:** TF log above.

### Important References
- **Code Branches:**
  - Current: `sprint_02_implementations`
  - Base: `main`

- **Documentation & Logs:**
  - Sprint plan: `Agents/Sprints/Sprint_02_Home_Location_Sessions.md`
  - TF briefs: `Agents/Targeted Fix/Sprint 02/`
  - User summaries: `Agents/Targeted Fix/User Summary/`

### Coordination Notes
- **Codex Review:** Up-to-date through Sprint 02 TFs.
- **Last Sync:** 2025-10-06 with user (validated login + location).
- **Next Sync:** Tomorrow when resuming Sprint 02 remaining stories.

## 4. Next Action Plan

### Immediate Next Steps (priority order)
1. **Session Endpoint QA** – Run host/guest token tests from TF log to ensure backend endpoints behave with real data.
   - Command: Use curl scripts in `Agents/Claude-Codex/Logs/2025-10-05_s301_s302_s401_implementation.md`.
   - Output: Confirm `session_id`, `join_code`, host/guest names.

2. **Invite Modal Wireframe** – Draft frontend flow for `Invite Someone` CTA to consume session API (S-401/S-402).
   - Files: `frontend/src/screens/HomeScreen.js`, new invite modal component.

3. **Deck Fetch Hook** – Plan integration for `Start Browse` CTA to call backend `places` endpoint once implemented (future Sprint 03).

### Testing Plan
- [ ] Expo login/register (online/offline) – confirm profile names.
- [ ] Location permission flow – good signal, slow signal, fallback.
- [ ] Backend session API with host & guest tokens.
- [ ] Optional: Verify Firestore logs no errors under fast refresh.

### Code Review Prep
- [x] Linter/test ready (no outstanding warnings from TF work).
- [ ] Once invite/deck features land, run full `npm run test` on backend/frontend.

### Risks & Blockers
- **AsyncStorage integration pending:** Low impact; login persists in memory only.
- **Session API untested on host:** Medium risk; must validate before exposing UI.
- **No deck fetch yet:** Known gap until Sprint 03.

## 5. Stakeholder Notes

### Pending Questions
1. **Invite UX Requirements** – need confirmation on invite messaging (SMS? share link?).

### Commitments & Deadlines
- **Sprint 02 target completion:** end of week (TBD by user).
- **Next demo:** after invite/deck flows functional.

### Communication Log
- Last update to user: 2025-10-06 (successful login + location and next steps).

---

## 6. Environment & Setup

### Current Development Setup
- **Branch:** `sprint_02_implementations`
- **Node:** 20.11.1 (noted upgrade need to 20.19.4+ before release builds).
- **Expo SDK:** 54.x.
- **New Dependencies:** `expo-location` already installed.

### Testing Setup
- **Expo Go:** Latest on user’s device.
- **Devices:** iOS (user tested) – location accurate; ensure Android check next session.

### Environment Variables
- `.env` in frontend/backend confirmed (user host). No changes this session.

## 7. Code Quality Checklist
- [x] All TF code committed and pushed to `sprint_02_implementations`.
- [x] Commit messages follow convention.
- [x] No merge conflicts.
- [x] Secrets remain out of repo.
- [ ] Invite/deck stories still pending.

---

## 8. Handoff Context

**For Tomorrow’s Session:**
1. Pull latest `sprint_02_implementations`.
2. Re-run login + location on device to confirm stability.
3. Execute session endpoint QA using real tokens.
4. Begin UI work for invites once backend validated.

**Key Files:**
- `frontend/src/context/AuthContext.js` – offline fallback logic.
- `frontend/src/context/LocationContext.js` – location improvements.
- `frontend/src/config/firebase.js` – app/firestore reuse + long-polling.
- `backend/src/routes/session.js` – host/guest endpoints.

**Context:** Sprint 02 infra is stabilized; focus shifts to building the invite flow and hooking to session endpoints. AsyncStorage persistence remains optional but recommended soon.

---

## 9. Session Retrospective

**What Went Well:**
- Rapid turnaround on TFs with clear logs and user validation.
- Firestore long-polling and reuse setup now robust.

**What Was Challenging:**
- Expo hot reload raising unexpected Firestore errors until reuse fix.

**Learnings:**
- Initialize Firebase in Expo with `getApp/getApps` guards to support hot reload.
- Combine Expo location options (timeout/maximumAge) with fallback strategies for reliable GPS flows.
